# Z-Machine Interpreter / Goz

This project contains a (currently partial) implementation of the zmachine specification 1.1 as a learning project for golang implemented using [bubbletea](https://github.com/charmbracelet/bubbletea) for the TUI.

README partial during early development. Basic state is currently:

- Many v1,2,3,4,5 games can be opened
- All functionality around windows/fonts/text colouring etc are not yet implemented
- There are still likely significant bugs in the implementation of basic operations

zork1.z1 (a v1 game) can be played for the first ~50 points or so before something goes wrong. Other games have similar patterns.
