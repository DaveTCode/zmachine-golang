Airlock


The alarms just went off, including the flashing lights. But the pandemonium will take a while to get out of your lungs.


The sealed chamber is immersed in darkness, the details lost in the corners where the lights from the fluorescent lamps are unable to spread. The exit door, in front of you, is blocked by three bars that alternately descend to the floor and up to the ceiling. A wide passage opens through a reinforced frame into a corridor to the south.


A voice shrieks from hidden speakers, repeating your name over and over again.

Attack of the Yeti Robot Zombies

This is a try-to-win-on-the-first-attempt game. The point of the game is to try to win on the first attempt. Or, failing that, to win in as few attempts as possible. You are not supposed to use "undo" or "restore" if things are going badly. (Though it is OK to use "save" and then later "restore" if you have to leave the game for a while. And it is OK to save the game as often as you like.)

Get it? Yes or no?

Ball Room


Though the room is filled with chatter, and couples still dance late into the night, it does not take a trained eye to see that the two parties keep entirely to themselves. Almeri to the left, Tanith to the right, barely so much as looking at each other except when etiquette demands. A breeze blows through the tall windows, the curtains drifting gently to reveal glimpses of the gardens beyond, and on the balcony the band still plays.




The kitchens lie to the north, the gardens east and stairs lead up to the balcony above. The main doors lie to the south, but you cannot leave without your father.




The ambassador's daughter is here, as you had hoped, your heart fluttering as you watch her gracefully dancing with the old general.

                 "To be able to fill leisure intelligently

                         - Bertrand Russell. 


       
                 "Finally a game worth playing." 
                         - Soolin, 'Games'.










Every day the same old grind, working for a miserable sum that only just allows for a comfortable existence, in a job with very little satisfaction.  It robs all your time, too; time you could fill with the million exciting projects flowing through your head.  So what are you going to do to break out of the rut?  How are you going to escape from the mire of bureaucracy that intrudes into every aspect of life?  Not by buying tickets in the State Lottery every week, that's for sure. No sir, the only way is to be bold, one big step.  So, you decide to steal five hundred million credits, and now is the point when action is required.  Brace yourself and plunge in - run the program on your terminal and then buy the exit visas.  But make sure you get your gun out of hiding first because today's the day.  It's going to be a big one; a very big one.  It almost seems a shame that you have to keep your secrets to yourself.  But you just can't trust anyone, you know.

Plaza


You are standing in a wide open square in the better part of the LonDome.  Bright sunlight shines through the white, translucent skin of the Dome high above.  All around you, people bustle about on unknown errands, mostly avoiding the seedy-looking alley to the south.  A small bookstall lies northeast, and stairs lead down to the subsurface shuttle terminal.  The view, however, is dominated by the imposing building in the east, it's marble facade soaring up to the heights of the Dome.

Ramshackle Hut

=== BibleRetold.z5 (v5) ===



You came for quietude and serenity - a break from the pressures of being constantly in the public eye. You came for a spiritual retreat: a chance to be with your Father, to think about your future lessons, to meditate on the problems of the world. And what do you get? You get followed - followed by shepherdless sheep, all too eager to be impressed, but not so eager to understand! Your miracles never cease, and neither does the attention you get because of them. 

Yes, the world here is a hostile place at the best of times. Hunger, famine, poverty and uncleanliness are rife. The people are unhappy. The Romans have quashed religion: the priests are corrupt and unholy. 

With the power of God inherently vested in you, only you can save the day. Up-and-coming leader of the people (and a new religion to boot), your followers have... well, followed you! They are weary from the journey and hungry too, but being so numerous, it seems only a miracle could possibly feed them all...

You have been locked in the study to raise money for charity (mate!) on the basis that no-one else in your year is reading English and Escapology - the organisers having used the objects already present in the room to leave clues as to how you will get out - without alerting college security!

Welcome to Brand X (Version 0.00)!

You don't need instructions, so you won't get any.

Problems, comments and suggestions to PDK1 or AJM8.

You are standing in a small shop which normally has various goods

displayed for sale. There are areas of the shop

obviously intended for the display of treasure.

There is an exit south, above which hangs

a large sign, which reads:

Calendar Room


Despite the introductory text, this is not a work of interactive fiction. It is an abuse of the programming language Inform 7. More specifically, it is a calendar viewer. Try, for example, typing "jan 1970" or "august 2007" or "year 2008". Individual months from January of A.D. 1 to December 9999 can be viewed, but the yearly calendar function is only available for years from 1753 forward.




In case you are wondering what possessed me to create such a monstrosity as this calendar viewer, type "why".

Front Room


You are here, at Sonny Rae Tempest's house, in Louisville, Kentucky, to interview him about his latest Atari VCS game poem "Calm, Mute, Moving." In your pocket is a note, on which you've scribbled some notes about potential question topics. 
Books, clothing, and shoes are scattered about the floor, so crossing the room seems a daunting effort requiring focus and proper foot-placement.

The front door
, which is locked (must ask Sonny Rae about key),
 is on the north wall, and the hallway is to the south.

In the desert


You stand in the middle of the desert on a sand deposit so large there is no dune in sight. Only the bright whitish sun hangs as the center piece to a boring portrait; A portrait you are not so sure if you are a part of. The sky glows a solemn blue turning into nothing but a haze as the horizon meets the burnt sand.



In each direction you can see hazy beginnings. To the west, you make out the glow of a city street. To the east you make out a giant cauldron. To the north you are unable to make out much of anything and to the south nothing but a pale white backdrop.

Weazle, the evil wizard has destroyed all that Conan loved. Now, after years of searching, Conan has finally found him. 
Conan is ready for revenge - he will KILL EVERYTHING!





Dungeon


Conan is in a damp dungeon, furnished only with 
an oaken table. The walls consist of yellowish clay. High up on the wall is a single, burning torch. 
A door, leading north, is closed. 



Weazle, the evil wizard spins around as Conan enters the room.

"Ha!", he cries, "here comes stupid Conan whose parents I killed, whose sister I sold to the orks and whose dumbbells I stole! You want revenge! But you will perish!" 

He taps his pointed hat, and a growling wildcat appears out of thin air!

"That'll be twenty five cents, Miss," says the driver as he helps you down from the carriage. You hand him a quarter and two nickels.


"Mighty lonely out here this time of year," he continues, slipping the coins into his coat pocket. "Are you sure you won't be wanting me to stick around? I'd hate to see such a fine young lady get herself stranded, especially with that storm blowin' in."


"Thank you, but I'll be fine," you assure him. "My fiance...," you start, then look away, unable to finish the lie.


"Ah, I see," he chuckles. "Well, then I wish you a pleasant afternoon. Just keep your eye on those clouds, ya hear?" Grinning broadly, he jumps up into the driver's box and releases the brake. Then with a flick of the reins he sends the carriage lurching forward, back down the rutted road between the cypress trees.


Finally, you're alone.

Rocky Point


High above the surf, Rocky Point offers a sweeping view of the western sea. From this lofty vantage point, looking south across a narrow strip of sand, you can clearly see the fractured granite cliffs that back the small cove below. To the north, the rugged coastline is dotted with offshore rocks and barren beaches, swept clear of sand by winter storms.


Turning toward the sea, you take a moment to soak up the last few rays of sunlight before the clouds roll in.

=== Cyclops.z5 (v5) ===





This very short interactive fiction game is only an experiment that is born from the question: "How many  adventurous ideas and puzzles can be drawn from some passages of a literature masterpiece?" 
Which hints, which ideas, to be more precise, can be taken from the Ninth Book of the Odissey, the chapter that narrates the famous adventure of Ulysses and the Cyclops? Let's see. 

Note: much of the text is taken from Robert Fagles' translation of the Odissey, published by Viking Penguin.

=== DDIV.z5 (v5) ===





You sneak through the door. So far so good. It was a smart choice to leave Aya behind. She would have just got in the way.

So this is it: The control centre. It is deserted, which is odd. After all the trouble you had to go through to get here... The wild Kroppie Kroppie on Starmus 7, the endless hassle with the four vending machines from hell, your successful reprogramming of the broken doorstop, which helped you vanquish the evil JanitorBot... And now you can just walk into the heart of the evil empire without any resistance? This is strange indeed.

But you are not one to complain when things are finally getting easy. Carefully, you plant the explosives around the room. Emperor Jacklejitt will never again be able to use his Psychotronic Strank-Inversor to enslave the cute yet intelligent Swoobies. The death of the Swoobie princess still brings a tear to your eye. 



Control Centre


Gleaming lights cover the walls. Several big screens are active. Some show the surface of strange, unknown worlds. Some display nothing more than stars. A big chair in the middle of the room looks like a throne and anyone sitting here must look very powerful indeed. It is clear that this is the heart of the evil empire. This is the centre of war and destruction. This is the office of Emperor Jacklejitt III.



Some explosives have been placed in the room.


A large torture table stands next to the throne.

=== Debate.z5 (v5) ===







Your suit has been dry cleaned, your politics file is up to date, and your new affirmative case has been completed and distributed among the team. You're ready for the All-Iowa Finals. This time, you're sure you and your partner finally have what it takes to win it all. Admittedly, things haven't gone so well in the last few competitions... but that was before you had these new arguments. There's only one thing left to do: copy that new negative disad you spent all night on. That should be easy enough.

Commons


The Commons is a grand, breathtaking vista of previously unimaginable beauty. At this time of the day, it's usually filled with students waiting for their parents to pick them up. Oddly enough, it's completely empty now. Long stone benches, showing evidence of recent occupation in the form of spilled gatorade, have been placed in a rough L shape in the center of the room. A hallway runs to the west, the east, and the north. To the south is the entrance (and exit) to the school.

It will forever remain one of life's mysteries: why should a simple man like yourself get on the wrong side of anybody? 

You are, after all, just a typical accountant. A little sideline romance with the secretary (what's she called -- Joanna) is a pleasant diversion from the tedium of your nine hour working day. Even your name, Charles Johnson, is unremarkable.

Unfortunately, in today's world, security is nothing more than an illusion. Predators, sometimes even our most trusted friends, make plans for our downfall. Unseen snipers close in, ready to pull the trigger when we least expect it.

Perhaps it's just human nature -- everybody has....

Princess Street


The weather has rapidly deteriorated, raindrops bouncing off the slanted marquee onto the pavement. Darkness comes early in the winter months, but fortunately the street lamps keep this area of the city well illuminated. The prospect of the warm lobby of the eight-screen cinema to the west becomes more attractive with each passing second.


You take another glance at your watch: twenty minutes to seven. Glancing up and down the street, the only pedestrian you see is a down and out disappearing into an alleyway. 
Where is she?


You had arranged to meet Joanna at half past to see a movie, and possibly a romantic dinner afterwards. It came as a relief when she accepted your invitation, with all the attentions that slimy boss of yours, Keith, has been giving her lately. Now you're beginning to think your short lived luck has run out already.

South Shore


You're at the southern shore of a wide river which runs east to west as far as you can see. A stretch of fine sand here makes for a scenic, if narrow, beach. A wooden dock extends out several feet from the beach into the water. Across the river, a hundred yards or so to the north, you can just make out the far shore. To the south is the road you drove in on, your delivery van parked off on the shoulder.




Tied to one post of the dock is a rowboat.

Is it an innocent affection? An irrational obsession? An outright fetish? Or just a handy reference point for the term "disposable income"? You're certainly not generally given to nostalgia. Whatever the reason, you still enjoy playing old video games. Real ones, from back when games were games and movies were movies, and they never seemed to get themselves confused.

It's not as if you need a reason. Taking genuine pleasure in something automatically justifies it (and, you're convinced, also justifies having caught a train to this weird city). You don't have to think twice about the reason for which you attend these conventions. There are, put simply, a lot of games inside.

So what if all your spending money went to the train ticket? Salivating never hurt anyone.

Baer Boulevard


People walk up and down this ribbon of old brick buildings, alternately holding hands and giving each other the finger. Since you're on vacation, you try to remain patient long enough to take in the sights; but since these are mostly made up of the immense hotel to the south, inside which is the convention, you find this difficult. Alleys open to the southeast and southwest, and a nearby manhole gapes from within caution signs. Amazingly, given their various apparent conditions, the passersby seem to be heeding this advice (enough to avoid actually falling in, anyway).

You'd been soundly sleeping, comfortably, soundly sleeping, when Dr. Todd called. He's your thesis adviser, and as such, he holds unconscionable power over you, which he uses for, well, whatever he likes, really. "Hagerston," he'd said. (You do have a first name, but no, nobody ever uses it.) "You do think it's important we apply our brains in a logical way, and not yield to mumbo-jumbo and mystification?" You acknowledged this was true. With Dr. Todd, a bad idea. The result was you agreed to meet him in front of the Hotel Farfalla at 3 AM. There was some reason, perfectly logical according to Dr. Todd, for this request, but you can't for the life of you now remember what it was.

Front of the Hotel Farfalla


The Farfalla is one of the grand old San Francisco hotels. Not the sort of place you'd go on your own. But then you're not here because you wanted to be. It's eight stories of still pretty much gleaming white marble, and no doubt a room costs as much a night as your apartment does for the month.
 It was founded in 1898 by Luigi Fornoni and this is the second building to bear the name. The first was destroyed in 1906 and Signor Fornoni rebuilt in an even grander style. You'd got that far on the brass plaque when Dr. Todd showed up. It was more than you really wanted to know.




"Well, Hagerston, I'm glad to see you're here in order to accomplish our mission."

Reluctantly, you crack a gluey eyelid to the world. Your head surges with pain, and you quickly shut it again.

The whiskey gods were not kind to you last night.

You search your memory for the reason behind this latest drinking binge. This proves difficult, because there have been many such nights since you were removed from your job as detective on the force. Now it comes back to you. The rent being past due on your new office. Marge badgering you about her paycheck. Your empty bank account. Your complete lack of clients. The money you owe Jimmy Voigt. You wince, not even wanting to think about Jimmy Voigt.

Last night, you took your troubles to ole Johnny Walker and he listened good. One drink led to another, and that naturally led to the next. Now you find yourself awakening on a cold, tiled floor. You bravely reopen your eyes and see that you are curled up at the foot of some private investigator's office door.         

Hey! It's your office!!

        PLOT INTRODUCTION


        A long time ago, when mystics, warriors and villagers 
        with smelly socks roamed the land, things were great. 
        You could slay dragons, beat up no-good thieves, and 
        even go on adventures with your drinking buddies. To 
        add to it all, there was a princess to chase after and 
        a king to swear allegiance to. All in all, life was 
        grand. 

        Until one day, that is...An evil dragon has taken refuge 
        in a nearby cave. As the King's chief dragon hunter, it is 
        up to you to slay the dragon dead. Good luck!

=== HallowEve.z8 (v8) ===






Today is October 31st, 1987. Your friends have invited you to join them for a night of camping and partying. The campsite is around a two hour drive from where you live now. You aren't sure who the property belongs to, but it's not far from where Fred Murks
'
 grandmother lived. You, Fred, and another friend of yours named Steve Dirks had made the site as kids before she died a couple of years later from pneumonia. You haven't been back since then. It was at least a cool place to go when you were too young to be smoking cigarettes because no one ever bothered you out there.




Your friends are bringing the camping equipment, food, and beer. It should be a fun night. Supposedly some girls were going to be showing up as well, but we'll see about that.




You come around one last tight curve and see Fred's car parked on the side of the road. It's probably safe to assume that they have already gathered their stuff and went to set up camp. You park nearby, and then feel the chilly air of the Fall afternoon as you step out of your car and lock the door...

You're Tracy Valencia, first-year student at the reasonably prestigious University of Dorado. Sure, it's not Berkeley -- hell, it isn't even Stanford -- but it's light-years better than Dorado State, where your older brother Trevor goes. Dorado State's just a party school. Trevor makes a point of rubbing this in every time he calls.

He'll be able to rub it in in person soon enough: it's Thanksgiving Day, and you're driving home. Daddy was perfectly willing to buy you a plane ticket, but like you told him on the phone, there are much better things to spend the money on. Birthday presents, for instance -- you turn eighteen tomorrow. Besides, it's only a four-hour drive.

Two and a half hours into said drive, the car starts making a noise no piece of machinery should ever make. It's the sort of sound a rhesus monkey might make being forced down a garbage disposal. Now, Dorado is nothing but scorching desert from the time you cross the coastal mountains until you reach the river; true, it's the scorching desert in which you grew up, but sentimentality aside, it's not exactly the best place in the world to find yourself stranded. But you've got to do something about this noise, if only because it's drowning out the stereo. So you pull over. You're just about to switch off the ignition when the car goes dead of its own accord. You try to start it up again, but absolutely nothing happens.

Guess what, Tracy? You're stuck on the loneliest stretch of Interstate Zero miles away from the last sign of civilization. It's twenty minutes to noon and the temperature's well over a hundred and twenty. You already miss the air conditioning. It's beginning to look like Ed and Sandy Valencia's only daughter might not make it for Thanksgiving dinner...

=== Leopold.z5 (v5) ===
It was a bright sunny day when the catastrophe occurred. Leopold, whistling softly to himself as he made his way back to Old Sam's cottage, carrying a quart of whisky which the old codger argued was necessary for the curing of his flu, heard his mentor sneeze mightily. It rattled the door as he stretched his arm to open it, vibrating it so much that it opened of its own accord.

Leopold poked his head around the door trying to judge the safety of the situation. It seemed to be okay. "Here," he said, striding into the rather sparse room, "I've got your medicine. Ol' Grumpy Boggert said you owe him five silver pieces."

"Bah!" said Old Sam, sucking heartily on his pipe and blowing the acrid smoke upwards where it scorched the ceiling. "Boo've baken bong enub!" he said to the Minstrel, arms reaching eagerly for the smallish barrel.

"Sorry," said Leopold, raising his eyebrows upwards to a brief encounter with his hairline. It was there and then that it happened.

"Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaachoooooooooooo!" sneezed Old Sam.

Leopold, falling over from the shock, was unprepared for the aftermath.

"By Lude!" screamed the old man. "I'be broken by Lude!"

Looking over, Leopold could see that his master had fallen out of his chair and onto the precious Lute of Lyranth. He cringed. It was priceless. And he rather hoped it was going to be his some day. He sighed. He knew, of course, what this meant.

"Boo'll hab do bix id!" said Old Sam. "I'b bar doo ill. Bed de nexd coach do High Biddledon. Bind someone dere. Bell? Move id busder!"

Leopold sighed again. He picked up the ruined instrument, and walked off. Hours later, after a rather bumpy coach-ride had done a little extra damage to the Lute, he found himself near to the town...

Outside the Inn


A soft cool breeze introduced itself to the Minstrel with an abundance of energy that not only thrilled his undergarments, but made the hot summer sun seem altogether less bothersome. Leopold stood on a rather dusty road and contemplated the building in front of him. It was obviously an inn, with a squarish wooden sign, standing at head-height, weathered and abused, announcing, rather originally and poetically, 'The Inn'. Its low white-washed walls returned the Minstrel's gaze with an expression that could only be described as stony, and windows suggested an interior that was condusive to ill-health. It brought a smile of joy to the Minstrel's lips. An oaken door stood slightly open to the north, allowing the smoky atmosphere a gasp of fresh air, and the road crept away westwards, towards the town of High-Biddleton. A fairly rocky path kept a low profile, twisting away to the south-east.




High above, Leopold could see a lantern, swinging easily in the wind.

=== LostSheep.z5 (v5) ===




All around you, your sheep are readying themseles for sleep. They nestle in the thick grass of the large field, clearly exhausted after a hard day of grazing. But there is dissent amongst the ranks! One of your sheep makes a run for the next field, jumping gracefully over the hedgerows. You stand up quickly and collect your crook. You need that sheep!



The Bible Retold: The Lost Sheep

A light-hearted adaptation of the Parable of the Lost Sheep, by Ben Pennington.

The lush green grass of this large field makes it perfect for keeping sheep. They graze all day, but the grass never seems to thin. Through the thick hedgrerows to the west lies another of your fields and a track winds north towards Bethlehem.

Light.








Streaming out of you as much as into you.








The element you live in, moving or no.








It doesn't diminish, but it sorts itself into regions, golden geographies, radiant solids.








It seems to be the fabric, force and measure of the world.








As if the ground itself were blinding sky.

Steps Of The Temple


The light takes shape, the shape of so many broad steps your eyes swim.  You can't see the edges of the steps to left and right where they taper into the distance, and the top and bottom of the flight also melt into the shining.  The golden stone they're hewn from seems hard enough to be eternal, soft enough to sink into.  The air is sumptuously cool, sweet.

[ For information about this game, type ABOUT. First time players of this game are strongly urged to do this right away. ]



August, 1876


"Men!" you snap at no one in particular as you hurry down the sidewalk. Up ahead you see Mrs. Jenkins take one look at you and head to the opposite side of the street, while Mr. Tutman and Mr. Lester look up from their checker game in front of the barber's shop and chuckle.


"Poor Sean..." you hear one of them say as you hurry on by. Poor Sean, indeed. They have no idea.


In your mind, you can still hear the investor's patronizing voices. "While we are sure you are quite capable, Miss Kelley," one had chuckled, "we really must speak with your uncle about financial matters such as these. You do understand."


Understand? Oh yes, you understand all too well. Never mind that it's your money, that you're the one who's really in charge of the business, handling the ordering, the hiring, keeping things running as smoothly as when your father held the reins. No, none of that matters. When it comes to talking money, a woman's place is... elsewhere. Men.


You stomp up the stairs of your uncle's favorite club, thrust open the outer door and step inside, already rehearsing today's lecture on promptness. The way things are shaping up, you can tell it's going to be a good one.

=== Mercy.z5 (v5) ===


You see, when the scientists had thought that the only smallpox around was in a very very small box kept securely closed, they were wrong.

When you come into the clinic today, seven people have already died. A nurse is missing. He's probably gone, too. You think that his name was Simon.

You're probably gone too, because every time you start talking, your words keep running together and together until you start saying dadadadadadadadada and then you have to drink some more, so that you can start euthanizing again.

What a funny word, you think. What a funny world.

E-Room 2



Cinderblocks painted white surround you. The sick smell of disinfectant hangs in the stale air. Overhead is a single light that has two settings: dim for before, bright afterwards. And off. A steel table, left over from biology dissections at the community college, is in the center of the room. It's cold in here, but the thermostat near the door says it's 76. The main hallway is to the south.




Another victim lies on the steel table. His face is unrecognizable, bloated with pustules blooming pink and red. Disease is written all over his body. He's naked; it's that much worse.

Toaster Hill


So there's this forest that's out of the way but not too far out of the way and some folks decided to dump their old household appliances. It's tradition, now. Toaster Hill is entirely literal; it overlooks a winding road to the south with what has to be 20 or 30 old toasters.  
The flashlight
'
s reflection gives the toasters a dull, gentle glare.
 
Once you had an argument with Tommy if it was possible for something to be beautiful and ugly at the same time, and he said no, and you said Toaster Hill, and he said ok sure you're right which is weird because your arguments usually lasted longer than that.

Beach


You're on a beach. It's very sandy where you're standing. To the north it becomes more watery, primarily thanks to the ocean. Above the ocean is a stirring sunset, the kind that would put young couples in the mood for porking of the romantic variety. Unfortunately for you, you're on your own. High cliffs climb above you to the east and south, and a path winds through small sand dunes to the west.

Field


The field stretches all around you endlessly, or at least for a few feet, which is the extent of your vision. Being as close to the ground as you are makes it difficult to see very far. The sky reaches out in all directions below you, the soft ground and grass above you, which is an unfamiliar feeling for you, but then, you've never been stuck on your back like this before.

This game is very loosely based on a few web searches of the real Ottumwa, and watching too much TV. 

The place: Ottumwa, Iowa, population about 25,000 and the county seat of Wapello County since 1844. It is historically known as the gateway to southeast Iowa because of its access to the Des Moines River and to the railroad. 

You have come here for a well-deserved vacation, to relax away from the pressures of your job in the big city.  By trade, you are a skilled forensics analyst working for the police department, but today you are planning on getting in some good fishing. You need to get a fishing license from the local sporting goods store.

=== Peacock.z5 (v5) ===


You came to Livadhia as a pilgrim, looking for Trophonius, for gods and lights.  A private consultation.

No luck: the Blue Guide is vague; the man on the street doesn't know what you're talking about; and when you tried the periptero where the bus from Athens comes to its lurching halt, the owner tried to sell you tickets to the Pythia.  "Just eight thousand drachs and no waiting in line!"  

As if the sort of advice you'd get at Delphi would help.  It's all a franchise now.

So you set off on your own.  It seemed hopeless, and perhaps it was.  But one mis-step in the thigh-deep leaves, and you ended here...

Peacock Chamber


A deep chamber walled in rock.  Light descends steeply from the oculus above, leaving a spot of elliptical brilliance on the dusty ground.  The walls are panelled, to a height just level with the knee: emerald, sapphire, ovals of amethyst, shadowed and dull.

There are two exits: one ceremonial, the vast lintel capped with a triangle of empty space, which leads south; the other low and secretive, leading east.



On 
the 
altar
 is

Bedsit


Rachel's bedsit is small and sparsely furnished, but is certainly nicer than living at home with Mum and Dad.  Her boyfriend bought it six months ago, and although he hasn't given it to her, he's quite happy for her to treat it as her own.  It's just this one room with a tiny bathroom attached.  To go to work she'll need to go out, but not until she's dressed.

Hot, foul, and dark. How did indoor theater become so fashionable? Well enough in spring rain or winter, but not in the thick, dead afternoon of high summer. And though 
Rito and Imita
 looks very fine, shining with electric moonslight in the enclosed gloom, you're much more aware of being crammed in neck-by-neck with your sweaty fellow citizens.


Damn the crowd, in truth: your mood was hot, foul, and dark when you sat down. Aessa was supposed to meet you here. She's made excuses before, and you don't think about what it might mean. Try not to think, rather. Just watch the story. One of your favorites. But it's miserably hot, and you just aren't caught up in the play...

If nothing else, you have a good seat.
 The stage is only a few rows to the north.
 People are jammed on benches in every direction; you think the aisle is somewhere to the west.



The play is into the final act. Rito has finally found out about Imita's affair, and he stalks the stage, whipping voice and hands about himself. A footfall behind him; he turns, and sees Imita. She backs a step at the force of his gaze.

July, 1892.




Father is off to Oxford again, and Mother's gone with him.  You know what that means: another day in the care of Uncle Stephen, who is nice but boring, and Aunt Emma, who means well but won't let you do anything fun.  Worst of all, it's a Sunday, which means you're sitting very upright in Aunt Emma's parlour, in all your stiff-starched Sunday best, trying to read Uncle Stephen's latest sermon about one of the less-interesting parts of the Bible while Aunt Emma pretends that she wouldn't rather be knitting and Uncle Stephen hides under a pile of Hebrew and Latin and Greek in his study.




Plus, it's gloriously sunny outside, and you can smell the grass from in here.  It's just not fair.  All the servants have the day off because Uncle Stephen and Aunt Emma don't believe in making people do any real work on Sundays, and you can bet that they -- Janet and Morris and Cookie, each of whom is loads more fun than Uncle Stephen and Aunt Emma put together -- are probably not all cooped up indoors in their Sunday best.




If only there were some way you could escape....

 (in

The parlour is Aunt Emma's domain, and is wonderfully comfortable and cosy on cold winter nights, especially when there's a fire going in the fireplace.  On warm summer afternoons, however, it gets stiflingly claustrophobic
.




You are ensconced in an armchair near the fireplace
.  Escape seems most likely either east into the hall or north into the dining room.




From her portrait above the fireplace mantel, Queen Victoria gazes benignly down on the room.




Aunt Emma sits by the window,

Your horse went lame five miles back, so you had to leave him at some peasant's farm and continue the journey on foot. It would have been tempting to rest awhile, accepting the peasant's rustic hospitality, but the king's orders were explicit - make for Swineback Ridge with the minimum of delay. Weary though you are from battling against rebels in the east, the king insisted that he needs 
you
 here, to take command of the hopelessly outnumbered army up on the ridge ahead, an army that's your homeland's last, best hope to turn back the barbarian hordes and avoid the fall of night.

For the tenth time today you wonder about the urgency. The last you heard General Chorza was in command of the army up on the ridge, and you know Chorza of old, a fine soldier and a good commander. So what is it that Chorza cannot handle himself?




Dusty Path


The long dusty path leads through untended fields up towards Swineback Ridge to the north.  To the south it leads back into the heartlands of the Kingdom of Lorayne, the land you are determined to defend at all costs against the barbarian hordes of the Phartipu. A narrow lane leads off across the fields to the east.

On the whole, it was worth the trip. The plains really were broad and grain-gold, if scarred with fences and agricultural crawlers. The mountains were overwhelming. And however much of the capital city is crusted with squat brick and faceless concrete hulks, there are still flashes of its historic charm. You've seen spires above the streets -- tiny green parks below tenements -- hidden jewels of fountains beyond walls. Any bland alley can conceal balconies wrought into iron gardens, fiery mosaics, a tree or bed of flowers nurtured by who knows who.


This alley, however, is a total washout. It ends in flat bare dirty brick, and you've found nothing but a door which lacks even the courtesy of a handle. Maybe you should call it a day.

End of Alley


It's a narrow dead end here, with walls rising oppressively high in three directions. The alley is quite empty, bare even of trash.
 (Your guidebook warned you: the
 police are as efficient about litter laws as about everything else they do.) You can retreat to the south.



A plain metal door faces you to the east, near the alley's end
. It's firmly shut

 Dear Blogreaders, 


 yesterday was the strangest day of my life! The things I have seen - and done - it was so strange...so horrible. And yet, wonderful. You remember that guy from the Psychology course? Paul? We had a date the day before yesterday. Some people already emailed me with questions regarding how it went. But sorry, especially to you, Toby43, but I was to tired, and, honestly, toO drunk to go online that night. I'll skip that part, maybe I'll write about it later, because I have to tell you what went down this night. Paul was throwing this big New-Years-Eve  party and he invited me (of course, I may add with what little self-esteem I have), to help him organize - and stay overnight.


 That's how it all started. I arrived in the midst of the party, because I was visiting my family before that. So when I went in the door, Paul rushed at me. I couldn't have anticipated what happened next, that this would turn into...

Paul, his brown hair in a cute pony-tail, rushes at you, a huge bowl of eggnog in his hand. He told you yesterday that he prepared it carefully after some old family recipe. He looks at you in utter horror, squeaking: "Mice."


"Of me to drop by?"


"No, Mice. They were in the house yesterday, and now one is in my eggnog." His voice is but a whisper.


"Hm, throw it away?" you suggest carefully.


"No, Alex, everyone is waiting for it. Also, the noodles haven't arrived yet and the sandwiches are disappearing rapidly.So people need something to feed on." 


Right at that moment, the head of a small mouse pokes out of the liquid. The little bugger looks around, then begins to swim around quite happily.


"Get rid of these foul vermin! Save my eggnog."

It is top secret. It is deadly. It is the ultimate war weapon. It smells like garlic.


You wake up. You can't anything. You can't remember last night. It smells like Garlic all around you. You panic to find that you are in a glass room, about 200 square meters, without any doors. Beyond the cage, you see a room painted entirely white. You hit the glass but it seems to be the hardest glass you've ever seen. You moan.

=== TheGrandQuest.z5 (v5) ===







You've spent the best part of your life as a man dreaming of the goblet. Its history stretches back through the ages, featuring in one legend here, another there, and always as the centre of events. Those who behold it are cursed or blessed, for it is the beginning of their true lives, marking the end of the mundane, and the start of the fantastical.




And yet none have ever possessed it. Sometimes it is in the hands of a stranger, but such a stranger is not a person, only the means to an end, a courier of destiny.




You seek it.
 While you've had a job, a family, your thoughts were always looking forward, dwelling on

Behind you is the entrance that you worked so hard to find. To the north, a craggy passageway leads into the distance, spotted with small pools of lava and cracks.




Here and there are decayed bits of foliage, and other assorted debris. In one corner, an animal seems to have made a nest of some kind.

=== TheInvestment.z5 (v5) ===


The year is 20XX, and the economy is in shambles. The market has fallen to its' knees, despite every effort on the part of the government and investors. Now, desperation is spreading amongst the people like a plague, with pressure building to find any way to save the market from utterly collapsing. Stock buybacks, pouring trillions in liquidity into the market, bailouts, tax cuts.. 

It's the start of a new day, what ought to be just another typical Tuesday on Wall Street. 
Today, however, the knowledge that you have been chosen burdens you greatly.

Your Bedroom


A small, mostly barren room, you use for sleeping, and checking up on the state of the world when here at home. The only illumination comes from your open computer which sits on a small desk. On the wall with your window hangs two pictures, one of your best friend, and another of your parents. Also here is your old mattress which sits on the cold hard floor. The solitary exit is to the south.

In the Ballroom


Four other people stand around the room, all staring at you for an answer. Mr Bromelle stands in the left corner by the maroon colored curtains with a large window behind him. It is a dark night outside. Mr Kalburry is over at the piano, playing an unmatched beautiful melody. Sharon sits on the cherry wood coffee table with a lit cigarette in her mouth. Every few seconds she takes a puff and then gives you a nasty look. Jack Haultairya is near the right side door, perched on one foot leaning up against the wall. He has a hand on the holster for his gun and the other with a lighter that he continuously flicks open and closed; flame then no flame. A roaring fire crackles behind you with a sudden 
hiss 
every once in a while. On the wall is a clock that makes a short ticking sound as if foreboding the moment when the time hits midnight. On the floor is a body, covered in blood with a bullet hole straight through his head.

This is the smaller of your two bedrooms.  You've been sleeping here for close to a year.  A small wardrobe contains your folded clothes, a shallow closet your hanging clothes.  A window looks to the east

Right, calm down. You've had your computer (an Apple II) since the mid 90s, before you could actually buy them at Apple Stores. It's so old now that the modem for connecting you to the internet has failed, and it's screen is cracked at the top where you hit it in your frustration because your favourite game from 1987, Bureaucracy, by Douglas Adams crashed before you could even load it. (The author of this game wasn't born in the 1990s, so he's only guessing that Apple II's had modems. Mind you, the latest MacBook has a thing called WiFi.) So, with that background out of the way, you took your ancient relic of a computer (it should be in a museum) to the Computer Lady in the hope that they could repair such machines.

Ever since you were young, you've been curious about the Romney Marsh, an area of Kent where the people seem to farm sheep, bell ring and goodness knows what. You've even heard a rumour that smuggling went on there during the 18th century, but that's now in the past. So, you pick up your tourist rucksack and, after checking out the various reviews on TripAdvisor, you are on your way.

Suddenly you feel rather dizzy, the room seems to spin around. You move to stand up and realize your not in your livingroom anymore, but now floating around in space with swirls of colours and stars spinning around you as far as the eye can see. You feel yourself being sucked towards a blinding bright light in the distance. You float closer and closer till you have to shut your eyes from the light, suddenly your hear a swishing noise then all is quiet.

Hello there!

So you are new to Interactive Fiction? You don't even really know what Interactive Fiction is?

Interactive Fiction is a genre of computer games that rely pretty much on text: what happens in the game, the description of the locations and your instructions are all text-based.

How such a thing is played?

Well, I'm here to help you. I'm the Tutorial Guide. We're going to play a very small game together, so that you can hurry back to enjoy the main game.

Then your baby brother was born. For a while he slept in mom and dad's room, but now he's been moved into the crib in your room. And now the monster found an easier target. That's when you decided that it ends tonight. You've decided that tonight you will kill the monster. . .

It is late afternoon, and the previously busy market place now has only a few stragglers trying to find last-minute bargains.
 Your stall is now devoid of all the home-grown delights that were piled on the table, and you are preparing to pack things away and return to your house.
It seems that Giles, next stall along, (for whom you have a secret fondness,) has also had a good day.  He stands, with the last remaining apple tree sapling that he has left for sale.
 You look shyly towards him, but all his attention is taken up gazing at Grace, the beautiful daughter of the local squire who approaches Giles' stall.

Hardly sparing a glance at the tree she throws some money at Giles' feet and instructs him to deliver it immediately to the Hall. 
 She sweeps away with a wiggle and a show of shapely leg below her silk gown, and Giles trots along obediently behind her like a faithful dog.

The Market Square


The market place has stalls arranged around its perimeter.    
The north side of the square is bordered by the entrance gate and boundary wall of the Hall, the squire's residence.
Your house is along the road to the east, and the dismal bogland trail leads to the west.
The southern road leads off to the big town many miles away which is far too distant to walk to.  


It's the end of the day and there is little left to buy, and few people still browsing.

West Of Chasm


You are standing at the edge of a deep uncrossable chasm
 with no memory whatsoever of how you got here, although the number 68 springs to mind for some reason
.  A not-especially-dark passage leads southwest and a grisly hole in the floor gives you the distinct feeling of being a one-way trip (one of those "you won't be able to get back up" situations).

Court Yard


A good sized courtyard with an air of late British colonialism about it.  To the west, in the direction the sun is setting, is a high, grey stone wall with an ornate iron gate set into the rock.  The walls of a large stone mansion rise several stories into the chilly evening air to the east, north, and south.  In the east wall, two or three stories up, is a large window.  On top of the west wall, above and to the right of the gate, is a large squirrels nest made of sticks, twigs, and leaves.

A carpeting of old brown leaves from past winters rustle about on the ground in the breeze and drift listlessly across a cracked, stained, pale green tennis court with a rotting net.  In one corner of the court yard an impressively large oak tree casts long shadows in the dimming light.  The acorns nestled among the tree's massive branches and vividly healthy leaves are new and green.  Near the tree is a quaint looking well of crumbling stone.




A rusty tin pail rests in the grass near the ball machine.




The tennis ball launching machine sitting in one corner of the yard looks like a relic from the 1930s.

Drawing room


The gentle sound of snow against the window pane suggests that it's cold outside, and you're glad to be here in the warmth. The drawing-room is reflected in the large looking-glass on the wall above the mantelpiece, and a very comfortable room it is too, with a warm hearth, a soft rug and an arm-chair that you can curl up and sleep in.




An abandoned chess board lies on the floor.



A discarded ball of worsted lies on the floor here.



Two kittens, one white and one black, are playing together by the arm-chair.

Outside the Barn



ACT I

Lancaster County, Pennsylvania

You are outside your barn, having just parked your buggy inside and stabled the horses. You brush the dust off the brim of your straw hat, loosen two of the hooks of your coat, and stroke your beard thoughtfully. Your adventurous spirit is tugging at you. Perhaps you shouldn't return to your home just yet.

"Oh, nothing so difficult as that. I'll be at the exit of this linear maze. The end is only three moves away on a straight line, and then one more move to get out." 

Oh my god a maze. Run screaming! You haven't confronted a maze since the one that killed your parents in Belize... 

But this is Significant Other. For this, for this... no matter what the cost. "What's a linear maze?" 

"It's laid out in a strict, simple, gridlike fashion, and all the routes are reversible." 

"It doesn't sound so bad." 

"Mmhmm. See you soon, my love. Mwa ha ha."

=== asterix.z5 (v5) ===


One more night. One more cold winter night. It's been a painful four weeks but you're SO close you can taste it. And then Mr. Rogers, your Ethics teacher can suck it.

You're going to be a senior and you have BIG plans coming up this summer. Tiffany is going to be life-guarding at the pool and she's promised to get you a cushy job at the snack bar. You'll spend your working days surrounded by cute boy lifeguards and your off-time at the mall.

But then your grades started to slip and, inconceivably, the topic of summer school has come up. To avoid this, you took Ethics 101 this semester, an easy "A". But, in order to pass, you have to perform some sort of volunteer activity for four long painful weeks. The concept of mandatory volunteerism seems odd to you but, nonetheless, here you are, working as a candy striper at St. Asterix Hospital, the oldest and most run-down hospital in the city.

It hasn't been too bad. You mainly do busy work: delivering flowers, passing out magazines, getting patients their slippers or whatnot. Tonight's your last night and your sponsor at the hospital, Mr. Jorry, was going to give you a letter confirming your volunteer hours after you also get the signatures of 8 patients and staff. But, rudely, Mr. Jorry has been found dead in his office. And, even worse, a blizzard blew in tonight and now it doesn't seem like you can even get home.

Mr. Jorry may have been killed and the killer may still be in the building, trapped inside by the storm. But, more importantly, you are NOT going to summer school this year and you'll unmask a murderer if you have to in order to get those signatures and that letter.

Second Floor Elevator Lobby


This is the second-floor elevator lobby. The elevator doors lie to the south, a small panel next to them. The elevator doors are currently 
closed
. A stairwell lies to the north through an open doorway. You see a red sign here that reads "Ward A" above an arrow pointing down the hallway to the west and a blue sign reading "Ward B" above an arrow pointing east. To assist the confused or dense, a red line starts here on the floor and leads west and a similar blue line leads east.

This is a very long room, lined with multi-tiered bunks. Flimsy partitions between the tiers may provide a modicum of privacy. These spartan living quarters could house hundreds, many of whom are sleeping here right now. There are archways on the north and east walls.

Visible exits: north (to the Long Hall and most of ifMUD), east (to the auditorium), south (to the Edifice Towers)

=== azteca.z8 (v8) ===


The initial joy of discovering the first combined shrine and temple of the Aztecs quickly evaporated into abject terror. As the jubilant archeologists and anthropologists and the rare artifacts they had discovered mysteriously started to disappear, dread gripped the excavation party camped just outside the pyramid. The expedition has ground to a halt as you, a world famous adventurer, are summoned to the pyramid to unravel the dark mysteries within. After an unbearably long airplane flight and a five hour bumpy drive from Mexico City, you finally arrive at the expedition camp site.

"Thank heavens!" an uncommonly attractive archeologist exclaims at your arrival. "We've been debating whether or not to quit the camp altogether and return to Mexico City." You have just enough time to drop your duffel bag in a nearby tent before you're fairly dragged over to an incredible causeway built by the Aztecs themselves. "There," your guide says pointing northward. "Just over the causeway and there you are.  Please try not to disturb any of the contents of the pyramid. We've barely started cataloging the contents and have hardly even explored the pyramid itself. The pyramid must be kept in pristine condition or the loss of history could be incalculable." Suddenly, the scientist's voice takes on an edge of stress and starts to talk much faster. "Thanks.  Alot. I'll just be going now." The archeologist fairly jogs southward leaving you to explore the dark pyramid and confront its mysteries yourself.

It's Christmas Eve. Rather late on Christmas Eve.

Just this afternoon your darling 7-year-old daughter Samantha announced that fully a week ago she mailed a letter to Santa Claus asking for Sugar Toes Ballerina, the unbelievably sought-after, impossible-to-find fad doll of the decade. Unwilling to see little Sam heartbroken on Christmas morning, you frantically phoned every toy store in town. Miraculously, you found a shop that claimed to have a Sugar Toes Ballerina in stock!

But that was two hours ago -- before the flat tire. Now it's getting dark, and icy weather is closing in. The address you were given, on the outskirts of town, has proven to be that of a dilapidated and disreputable-looking shopping center -- not a modern chrome-and-neon strip mall, either, but a hulking two-story structure that looks to be the ill-favored offspring of a fairy castle and a canning factory. The shopping center is tucked well back from the street among brooding skeletal trees. Other than a few dim yellowish lights that show no trace of holiday spirit, the building is shrouded in gloom, and yours is the only car in the parking lot.

The Parking Lot


Except for your car and the dirty snowdrifts in the corners, this broad expanse of pavement is entirely empty. The wind whistles a little, and instinctively you hunch your shoulders and turn up your collar. The dark bulk of the shopping center squats in decaying splendor to the south, and a paved walkway leads in that direction.

  Heads fly and body parts soar through the air as you swing your mighty sword at the horde of evil barbarians. One by one, the minions of the evil overlord Kroz persishes from the wrath of your unforgiving blade. As the last of them collapse in a bloody heap at your feat. You raise your arms and shout out in victory. Princess Zomar rushes up to your side and caresses your bulging pectorals.
  "Thank you, mighty one, for rescuing me from a fate worse than death," she says in a breathy voice.
  "Say no more," you respond. "It was not just my duty. It was my privilege."

  "You are wounded," she gasps as she sees the cuts along your rippling biceps. "I must annoint them with various balms and ointments. I need to gather the magic healing lotion and rub it ever so thoroughly all over your body. But first, I must dress the wounds. Please forgive me, for I have nothing to dress them with apart from my sheer silk nightgown."
  With that, she starts ripping off large shreds of her gown and gingerly wraps them around the wounds, taking time to slide her hands over your body. She leans towards you ear, brushing her large billowy breasts against your shoulder, and whispers, "BEEP BEEP BEEP BEEP"

Your Bedroom
 (
on
 
the 
bed
)


You blink your eyes as the blaring alarm jars you into waking reality. You come to the sad realization that it was all a dream. The well-endowed Priness Zomar ceases to be and your bulging pecs have been replaced by the reality that is your huge beer gut.


Your bedroom is a nicely orchestrated mess. Clothes and furniture are strewn about in an almost artistic fashion. Salividor Dali would proud, if you had any idea who he was. Right next to the unmade bed is a tiny, wooden dresser. The only exit is to the south.



On 
the 
tiny wooden dresser
 is
 
a
 
alarm clock

"Hello, kiddies, welcome to the first ADDition of TALES FROM THE COLLEGE. I'm your host Mr. Worse, Dean of PERMANENT student residence. Since this is my FIRST-YEAR show, I wanted to show you a DOUBLE ROOM but I had trouble selecting a roommate. I couldn't DIFFERENTIATE between them. So, tonight I've decided to introduce you to Kevin Johnson. But unfortunately he's been experiencing a BINARY BREAKDOWN. Perhaps, you can ADVISE him or maybe all he needs is...A BREATH OF FRESH BLAIR!"

*SNAP* That was the sound of your last nerve cracking. You've lived here in Blair Hall too long. The neglectful RA, the screams at night, the fights in the halls and the vomit in the bathroom. You've tolerated it all until now. But now the sight of the broken dryer has caused the very last ounce of tolerance you had to come smashing down. You mind has performed a complete register dump of it's ability to think rationally. You are experiencing a BINARY BREAKDOWN!

Laundry Room


This room is supposed to be the laundry room. If not for the word of your RA you would easily have believed that this was the junkyard. The hallway is to the east.



A broken dryer slouches in one corner.



The companion machine, a washer, sits beside it.

"Twenty-three dollars," he's saying. "Twenty-three dollars for the best dream of your life."

You don't know his name or anything -- he's just the guy you always meet at parties thrown by people you've never met. He's nobody's friend, exactly, but everyone knows who he is when it's time. Probably doesn't even have a name, probably has bagged groceries at some godforsaken Shopper's Food Warehouse since high school, but who cares? He's here to help you in your hour of need.

"What do you say?" he asks, holding up a repurposed cough syrup bottle with something green inside. Green like candy almost never is.



Stuck in an Attic


Sure, you're used to piece-of-shit architecture (you live in Dundalk, for crissake), but this place will be receiving some kind of award from you by the end of the night. There's totally unimportant crap strewn all over the place -- old sewing machines, an Easy-Bake oven, even a set of folding chairs painted carnival blue -- but fortunately, almost all of it is in shadow thanks to an underperforming fifty-watt bulb directly above.

It's just you and the dude here. The only place in the entire house you could get any privacy. It's only ten o'clock and already the call to hook up has come down from the heavens.

Stairs lead downward, back to the party and that awful trance-bop they keep playing.

As the security guard waves you through, you linger for a moment to absorb the historic nostalgia of your surroundings... 

Paramount Studios. 

You can almost feel the ghosts of Gary Cooper and Cecil B. Demille brush past as you clutch your knapsack close to your heart. Inside the tattered little sack is the culmination of two years work: a seven part mini-series you've written on the life of former vice-President Walter Mondale, entitled 
Fritz, We Hardly Knew Ye.
 Beaming with pride since the completion of your epic, you've had your sales pitch memorized and well-honed for weeks now; certain of success once you finagled an appointment with that legendary television producer, Irving M. Sowritch. A quick glance at your appointment slip affirms your timing is perfect. In a few minutes you'll have him eating out of your hand.

An avid devotee of film history, you've read a great deal about this grand old piece of real estate. You feel as if you know it well. Looking around, you begin to imagine which of these historical offices you'll soon be calling your own. But you quickly shake off the seductive daydream, intent on remembering the security guard's directions: northeast to the Administration building, then straight ahead until you're outside Sowritch's office.



Melrose Gate


This is the grand entrance to the studio lot. For almost a hundred years the famous arches to the south have been the portal beneath which Hollywood's greatest stars have passed on their way to silver screen immortality. A pleasant walkway heads west, while the studio's main administration building can be seen off to the northeast.

It's a clear summer night in London.  You walk purposefully down Langley Street in Covent Garden looking for the pub.  It's nearly time and you can't be late.  Tonight is the most important night of your life.  Ah! Here's the pub! You enter and walk directly to the bar, weaving in and around throngs of patrons happy to be enjoying a drink after a day's work.  You approach the bartender and inquire. You were told to speak to Nigel.  The bartender confirms he is Nigel and he asks your business.  You give him the reply just as you were told.  He nods his head solemnly and asks you to follow him.


He leads you to a door towards the back of the bustling pub. He gives the door two sharp knocks, pauses for three seconds then two more sharp knocks.  A regal voice from behind the door simply says "Enter!".  With that, Nigel hurriedly backs away and turns tail to resume simpler, safer duties tending bar.  You enter the room dutifully and close the door behind you.  Looking around you are deeply impressed with the furnishings.  Lots of red cloth, leather couches and recliners, the heavy smoke of cigars and the presence of just three men.  You know you are in the presence of true masters of their craft.  One of the men you recognize as your mentor, Simon.  The other two gentlemen you haven't met before.


The youngest man, perhaps 25 years old at best, rises and looks you over.  "I am the Grand Bastard." He has an unmistakable British accent. "Who sponsors this apprentice bastard?", indicating you. Your mentor rises and claims responsbility for the sponsorship. "Very well, let the trials begin.  I shall go first."

"An utterly clueless network user calls and asks you why the network is running so slow.  What is your response?"

"I cheerfully volunteer to immediately inspect the co-worker's computer, diagnose the problem and repair it." With this, you can see the Grand Bastard is greatly offended.  Undaunted, you continue..." I get under their desk, open the computer case and swap out the 100 megabit network card and replace it with a 300 baud modem with the speaker disabled.  I close the computer cover, plug the modem into a phone line, boot up the computer and make lightning-fast configuration changes the user can't follow.  When I'm all done their 100 megabit per second connection is reduced to a 300 bit per second connection via demand-dial connectivity.  Without a doubt, they will never call me and complain again."

You wait breathlessly for the reaction of The Grand Bastard.  "That is an excellent solution.  You have passed my trial." Looking around at his two peers he continues, "Indeed, your response is so thorough, so diabolical and so effective I think we can dispense with the remaining trials.  Are we agreed?" Your mentor and the other BOFH both nod their assent.


"Then it is done.  I confer upon thee the formal title of Bastard Operator from Hell.  Return to the United States of America and do us proud.  Now.  Go! Begin thy tenure!"

Mission Control


Your office, where you carry out your Bastardly duties, is equipped with the finest furnishings and equipment necessary to perform your work.  As you have an aversion to cheap kit, your desk is the finest example of office furniture ever bestowed upon the human race.  Sitting atop this monument to furniture is the single most powerful computer in the company; your personal workstation.  Only two decorations adorn the walls; a Bill Gatus of Borg poster and a daily calendar.  North leads out of Mission Control to other, less important areas while you spot a very large and serious looking door down the hall just east.



On

The Town Square


You are standing in the middle of a pretty town square in the center of a nondescript New England town.  Like most any other nondescript New England towns, there's not much to see or do here, but maybe you'll find something amusing and enjoyable to do.




A shiny metal phone booth sits in the center of the square.

=== brainofthenightguest.z8 (v8) ===






After dreams of swedish fish fountains and 5-cent space otter rides, you find yourself unwillingly dragged back into consciousness. You open your eyes slowly to the sight of a completely bare ceiling. Your thoughts swim aimlessly in your head, trying to figure out what was happening before you passed out.




"Hi there!" a chipper voice says. You raise your head and see the flashing light-eyes of a maintenance bot. "Seems like you were unconscious in the bathroom! I moved you here."




Oh yeah. You had been on a field trip with your class to the Plutonian Commonwealth museum, learning about ancient technology and the history of the braintree and lots of educational stuff. As always, you find things way more educational when combined with the results of your pharmaceutical class, so you got totally fruitbat flapjacks on yesterday's lesson. You guess it must have been too much for you and you passed out.




"Sorry, but the museum's already closed and your tour group has gone. Since you're not supposed to be here, we'll have to have the security guy take you to the police in the morning. In the meantime, I'm off duty, so -" the light-eyes of the maintenance bot die out as it goes into sleep mode.




Dang. You've taken so many liberties in pharmaceutical class, you'd have a ton of paperwork to do if the police end up taking you out of here. You're going to have to find an exit on your own.

Maintenance Room


You are in a sparse, small room with no decoration whatsoever. It stinks of garbage, metal and oil.  From here, you can go north into the main museum hall, west into a nasty little break room, and east down a smelly hallway.




A pile of fat black garbage bags take up most of the room.




Nearby, a maintenance bot squats, inactive and shut off.

You are wearing a leaden overcoat stumbling down a hallway filled with strobe lights. Anxiety runs like an electric wire through your frame as you can feel the eyes upon you; eyes, forever-staring; eyes boring holes through your back; eyes peering out from translucent drawer-like plates in the hall. You hold your breath hoping somehow to black out, but the floor melts and the scene shifts. 

You are running down an endless plain on a moonless night, where the stars sit in judgement like needles waiting to fall upon you. It rains clocks and they pelt you as you run, dodging shattered stopwatches and blaring alarm clocks. The scene shifts again. 

Every action seems in slow-motion as though you were moving through time. You raise your head to look in the mirror and see yourself growing older, a year for every moment. You turn away and look back to see a skeleton staring back at you, its jaws gibbering madly. 

Then you are sleeping. A gentle touch upon your shoulder and you awake, blinking into focus a strange and yet uncannily familiar world. The abandoned parking lot and the broken streets keen with secrets just out of reach. Before you is the building. It lurks like a coiled dragon, a summation of fear and deadly challenge, of past and of present. You hear a final distant voice that seems a greeting as well as benediction, "This is the dark night of the soul."


Building

The building lurking before you, an endless night.

Before the Building


The building rises before you, a hulking shadow, blocking out the stars above and disfiguring the moon. Windows upon windows pit its smooth obsidian surface, glinting like tiny gasoline-colored eyes. A garrulous display of floodlights spray up from the ground floor like failed fireworks, casting writhing shadows from the dense bushes that ring the building except where the sidewalk splits them asunder. The slate sidewalk continues from the building, between the hedges to end at your feet, eroded smooth.

Before the Building

=== bunny.z5 (v5) ===




  The voice still echoes in your head. "Remember--if the bunny is not dead by midnight, the countryside will be ruled by evil." 

  You shiver as you think of the people dead in the street with bite marks on their neck. The cattle dead by the hundreds. The stories of a rampaging vampire bunny. A chill runs up your spine. 

  And lastly, you remember the strangeness of the graveyard the last time you saw it. The misty fog surrounding it. And now you're in the graveyard, alone, armed only with your apple and your trusty quill pen.

Top of the lighthouse


You are standing at the top of a lighthouse, with glass panels all around the circular room. It is pitch black outside and rain pounds the glass. The occasional lightning strike lights up the night sky giving you a brief glimpse of a lifeless horizon and a dark, empty sea. Steps lead downwards into the lighthouse.




The main lighthouse lamp stands impressively in the centre of the room.

Saying your uncle Xevion is odd is an understatement. He is also absent-minded.
But when uncle Xevion asked you to run back to his house to retrieve his

you go to pick up the necklace from the mantle, it falls off into the fireplace.

You are standing on a steep sided hill. Behind you to the east is a range of mountains trapping the city against the sea. In front of you would once have been a forested plain stretching down to the sparkling sea. You can imagine the first humans to see this place, standing on the hilltop, the ancestors of this great city in front. You feel a sense of kinship with that ancient people, as you stand knowing that you will be the last person to see this now metropolised, cultivated plain.




Hilltop


You look across a city to the sea on the far side. A silent city. The hilltop itself is barren of trees, although the steep slopes around are wooded. You must be standing a good forty or fifty metres above the city below.




A dull star stands out against the cloudless twilight sky. It will soon hit the earth four hundred miles away.




People stand around you.

Welcome to the Kingdom of Zork!

You are bored. There's nothing on TV except some stupid reruns.

You wander into your local book store and pick up an interesting-looking book entitled Zork: The Cavern of Doom. As usual, you turn to the first page and begin reading.

The book is set in the magical land of Zork, where a new, incredibly rich underground realm has just been discovered. Dozens of adventurers have entered The Cavern of Doom, but none have returned. Only YOU can save them! There are bad-tempered warlocks, huge diamonds, dragons, and a giant empire to explore.

It looks like this book is good!

What do you want to do?
[1] Do you choose to save the kingdom? If so, read on!
[2] Or do you choose to go home and watch reruns?

You've been excited about THIS trip for more than a month! Your troop is going on a caving expedition to Cumberland Caverns! You've just finished your homework for the weekend, and are all ready to pack for the trip. Being a newbie to the caving scene, you are glad that the troop provided a packing list for you. However, during the week you lost the list somewhere. So you'll either have to find the list or pack what you can remember from memory. 


Your mom comes into your bedroom and reminds you that you only have an hour before you have to leave, so you'd better pack quickly.

Note:  Before playing this game, you should type in the command "info" for an introduction.  If you get stuck, a hint is provided by the command "arrrgh".  That's three r's.  Thank you.


    It is the year 2753.  You are engaged in a contest, a race across the galaxy to acquire the Toaster of Battle Creek Michigan (the last functioning toaster in the known universe, and therefore extremely valuable.)

    You like to win.  To ensure your success in this competition, you sabotaged the starships of the other participants.  Now you alone (or at least you and your faithful assistant Walter) have discovered the cavern of the Toaster.  Gloatingly, you ordered Walter to lower you into the cave...

    But your rope snapped, and now you're trapped here - perhaps forever...

Treasure Chamber


This is one of the largest caverns you have ever been in.  The ceiling is forty feet up, and the walls are quite a ways away.  The ceiling is supported by massive pillars formed from stalactites and stalagmites.  The phosphorescent moss that lines the walls provides a dim glow.  Mysterious carvings have been left on one wall.  There is an opening to the east.

    In the center of the cave stands the object of your quest:  The massive, thirty-foot pedestal on which the legendary Toaster of Battle Creek has stood for centuries.

Outside the Cheeseshop

=== cheshire-cat.z5 (v5) ===




This year too you decided to go for a walk to the book fair that takes place in the old town centre. After visiting the stand of the "Ludo Ergo Sum" club run by your friends Mario e Luigi, on the right side of the main street, you headed to Miky Bar to drink a beer to their health.

You're still having your drink when Mario bursts into the bar and says that the Cheshire Cat is missing! It is an unruly feline that meows all the time and pees and poos everywhere. But it is also the mascot of the club: without it your friends can't organize any other event, so it's a matter of life and death to find it as soon as possible.

Before letting you to your mission, Mario reminds you the rules to play a text adventure:

  - Every command has to be inserted with the syntax verb + noun: >get beer, >open door, >examine jacket, >wear hat, >ask girl about cat, >hit vandal...

  - To move from one place to another within the game world, you have to use the directions >north (or just n), >south (s), >east (e), >west (w), >up (u), >down (d).

  - The command >inventory (i) prints the list of the objects you have, while >look (l) shows the description of the place where you currently are.

  - The verbs you can use in this game are: get, examine, show and give [something to someone], ask and tell [someone about something], answer [something to someone], wait, sing, sleep, jump, listen, wear, remove, open, close, unlock, lock, hit, empty [something on something else], eat, drink, play, burn.

  - Examining the furnitures and the details mentioned in the descriptions of the places allows you to find hidden objects and important information. By speaking with the other characters you can know what you have to do to obtain their help.

  - To read again these instructions and information about the author and the software license type >info or >instructions.

Have fun!

You never wanted to be a scientist. It bored you, it did not interest you. 

But the years went by fast and before you knew it, you became a PhD student. All due to a new branch of science that emerged and caught your interest. With the research come access to the clean room. This clutter-free environment also helps you think. What you and your research group are working on could truly change the world. And, by the looks of it, will happen soon. If this falls into the wrong hands... 

Insomnia. Again. It was 2 in the morning when you got here, was it not? The clean room. Again. It calms you and really helps you focus on the work even with other personnel present. But you are currently alone. This is impossible. Protocol clearly dictates that at least one person from the maintenance crew has to be present at all times. They must have left earlier when you were too engrossed in your work to notice. Oh well. Time to go get out of this place, it must be early morning by now.

Clean Room


A white sterile-looking room with an assortment of technical equipment, yet covered completely in yellow by the light tubes above. The air temperature and humidity levels are strictly controlled and, much like your life, never change. Fan units are humming in the walls. There is an array of cabinets for storage.




The airlock door marked alpha to the east is your only way out.




One smaller cart is standing in a corner.

Isn't it always like that? You spent a hot morning chivvying the plow and the Bishop up and down the north field. No satisfaction there -- it's just to turn in the clover. The view and the Bishop's hind end never change -- a mule's ass no matter what you call the mule, and Reverd Pearson has lectured you enough about calling him "the Bishop," but you figure he's your mule so you can call him what you like -- the mule, that is, not Reverd Pearson -- anyway, a whole morning and now it's time to chop the wood, and your good axe has gone missing.




Reverd Pearson would say you're a careless lunkhead who'd lose his ear if it wasn't nailed on. You figure he's right, a man of the cloth, but that doesn't mean piskeys didn't steal the thing. You know about piskeys.

Your Front Room


Reverd Pearson says a man's home is his fortress. Your home is two rooms of dressed timber, but the roof doesn't leak, so that's fine. Not enough of a fortress to keep out the piskeys, though, it seems. The front door is west, and east is where you sleep in back.




A maplewood table stands in the center of this room
. It's your home's pride (though the Reverd has warned you about pride) -- a handsome furnishing that your cousin down the road made for you when your house was raised
. Every time you walk in you're pleased to see it. Only there should be an axe leaning against the table's corner, and there isn't
.




A battered book is lying on the table, though
.

Balcony


You are sitting. Sitting on your usual chair at the balcony. You are drinking milk coffee. You are waiting, but nothing ever changes. You don't know what you expect to change. But you are waiting. Something has to change, you know it. If you wait enough, something will change, you know it. You feel it.

"Los Angeles, California. City of Angels." 

"Not so fast, Sherlock; I'm no angel." She pauses, the cigarette poised an inch from her lips. A stray beam of sunlight leaks from a broken slat in the venetian blinds, spotlighting her hair. Blonde. Platinum, not gold. Abruptly, she reaches across your desk to push a stack of green at you, past the halfway point. Her eyes watch yours as she fans the money out on the desktop. "I never mix business with pleasure. Do you?" 

Not often. Not lately. "Not me," you assure her. "Wouldn't dream of it." 

She leans back in the chair, studies the smoke curling from the cigarette between her fingers. "I--we don't visit L.A. much anymore. My husband, he hates it; won't go near the place. Calls it the City of Angles. Says everybody's got one, you know? An angle, I mean." 

"Your husband sounds like a man with his head screwed on tight." 

She laughs, a short, bitter sound with no amusement behind it. "That night, I did go to L.A. Without Walter. When I got home, late, the cops were waiting for me." She kills the cigarette with a quick stab at the ashtray. "If Walter dies, I'll inherit millions. My alibi--well, let's just say it doesn't help. Get the picture?" 

Her old man was right, everybody's got an angle, even dames with more curves than a mountain road. A guy could hurt himself on all that geometry.

Darkness

=== darkiss1.z5 (v5) ===



You open your eyes, feeling alive again, after being... dead?

Who are you? You need some time to remember.

It's dark, but you can see.

You are in a sinister place, and should be frightened. Or perhaps not...

You are unbearably thirsty, but not for water.

Crypt
 (in 
the 
coffin
)


Hidden in the bowels of the mountain, this chamber has hosted your immortal body for centuries, while your foolish enemies spent their miserable days hunting for you in your castle. The coffin is on a stone pedestal at the centre of the room. On the ceiling is a fresco of the red sun of Valmar. To the east a narrow tunnel leads to the other rooms of your lair.



You're lying in the coffin, very weak. You struggle to keep your eyes open, while your necrotic flesh recovers its former appearance. You feel a stab of pain as you remember the stake that was driven through your heart. You should be dead, but you aren't. Something happened.

=== death.z5 (v5) ===


It was only seconds ago that the sound of a gunshot caught you off guard.  Now, here you are, cradling your sidekick and friend, Snam, close to the ground.  "Not Snam!!" you think to yourself, "After all he's done for me..."  It was he who took care of your niece when your sister asked you to babysit.  It was he that always let you win in Stratego. Now, in this final act of selflessness, he lies dying from a shot from Doctor Nova's gun, leaking life from the very bullet that was meant for you.  Tears well up in your eyes when you think how Snam will never get that plant you got him for his birthday.  You spent so much time picking it out and everything...

Your attention is diverted by an evil chortle, and your gaze barely catches the blur of white as Doctor Nova runs out the door to the north.  You'll pursue him soon enough, but for now, your attention returns to your fallen comrade.

"Listen," Snam chokes out. "You gotta get that bastard." After these final words, his body promptly goes limp in your hands.  You carefully lower him to the floor.

"Oh, I'll get him alright," you growl to yourself as you turn towards the door.  "I'll get him good."

The Beginning of the End


You and Snam came a long way to get this far.  First, you had the trouble of tracking down clues and following the trail of innocent victims that led you here.  Then, there was the battle of epic proportions with Nova's countless minions.  To top it off, you had to deal with that dastardly crocodile pit (and you would've helped Snam wrestle them, too, if only reptile skin didn't make you feel so icky).

But now, Snam's dead and you've got to make things right.

You have an ominous, uneasy feeling, walking about this room. You're not sure whether to attribute this to the eerie, curious shadows that dart about the floor and walls or to the fact that you made the unwise decision to fight evil with a stomach full of chili. The doorway to the north seems to be your only exit.




Your friend, Snam, lies dead on the floor, face 
up.

You crawl through the tight passageway, your lantern swinging in your hand, casting shadows that play about all around you.  Perhaps a human would be claustraphobic here, certainly one of the Elves would, but you are a Dwarven Reclaimer, sent to explore and prepare the abandoned city for the return of its people.  The ancient city awaits, just a little further up.  You shuffle farther in until you finally see the wooden doorway that brings a large bearded smile to your face.  You're there!  You have finally reached...

Secret Entrance


This is a rather dark and small room, having only two exits, back north the way you came, from the ancestral homes of Tana, or through the heavily barred wooden door before you that leads southwest and inward to the abandoned Deephome, abode of the Dwarves in Telleen.  It has been three hundred years since your people lived here.




The door blocks the way into the city of Deephome.

Darkness; below, percussion throbs softly. You shift from foot to foot, conscious of too much open space around you.

Ahead and on either side, the voice of the chorus rises; as they speak, the lights slowly go up.

CHORUS:
Now does the hour grow close; where feet lack time,
And Spaniards rage before the Cockrel's gate,
The condemned sinner, soul turned sick of vice,
Shall craft before your eyes most unclean magics,
Open him a gate to Hell's black womb,
Release demons, and bid them convey
Our heroes to fair France; there to signal
Embattl'd men to a final desperate measure.
The final act is begun; the play is in your hands.

=== doll.z5 (v5) ===





When you saw the ugly little doll in the shop window you knew you had to have it. It would make a great addition to your collection of mysterious items and artifacts.

The doll stood only about a foot tall and seemed to be made of a tough leathery material. Its head was small and misshapen, and its long, razor-sharp teeth could be seen protruding from its mouth. It wore a little gold talisman around its neck and wielded a cute little six inch sword. The sign read "Genuine African Zuni Doll. Only $19.99"

After bringing it home and taking it out of the box you read the little information sheet that came with it.


"African Zuni Doll"




"It is said that the Zuni Doll is inhabited by the spirit of an African Tribesman who died while committing a cowardly act. In order to let the deceased regain his lost honor, the tribe's witch doctor imprisoned the man's spirit in a doll and a talisman that he created especially for that purpose. The spirit remains trapped until it atones for the cowardice the tribesman committed and proves its bravery. To accomplish this, the Zuni Doll must complete a near impossible task: hunt and kill, 25 human.

"Fortunately, the Zuni Doll is harmless as long as it continues to wear the gold talisman. The magic in the talisman keeps the Zuni Doll from coming to life and carrying out its mission of blood."

Now, you are lying in bed thinking of the little doll when you feel a slight pressure near your feet. Looking down you see your cat, Elmo, crawling towards you. You reach down and give Elmo a good scratch behind the ears. That is when you notice something small and golden drop from his mouth.

A bedroom. On the right is a bed, and a bookcase behind it. From the window across, beams of light are gliding inside. You can see a part of a building through the window.

Walls are white. A picture of flower is on the wall. A red rose with a black background. The bed with white sheets is undone.

A man with straggly hair in pajamas with dark blue stripes, is walking to left. He has fuzzy slippers. He's scratching his butt.

The reaching big white hand of the bed is about to hold the man from behind.

 Your head hurts, and -- You're lying on the floor. You're staring at the ceiling, and it's rough and grey, and you don't recognize it.


You roll slowly (smooth cold floor?) and try to sit up. It hurts. You crawl upright. The walls, rough stone also, scrape your aching fingers. You can't -- there was white agony, felt like raw light tearing you apart. You can't remember anything after that.


You can't remember anything

=== dumont.z5 (v5) ===
You pull on a pair of jeans and a sweatshirt, collect your books and head out for class. Gregory Dumont, Ph.D. is giving one of his crash courses in physics and you swore this time you'd get the stuff down cold.

As you approach the classroom the smell of popcorn wafts through the door, and you find Dumont inside, showing a Marx Brothers movie to an empty room.

"Oh! So we have a class! Welcome!" Dumont says excitedly as he ushers you in. He looks at the film for a moment, chuckles, then switches it off. "Since it's just the two of us, and it's a nice day, why don't we walk over to the Research Zone? I'm working on an experiment there," Dumont says, scratching his wild frizzy hair then reaching for his coat. "We can consider it a lab class."

The Research Zone, shrouded in mystery since the last big experiment blew the roof off the billion-dollar facility, has been off limits to students. You are honored that Dr. Dumont is allowing you, a lowly physics student, access to a privileged area.

After walking for what feels like miles down the brightly lit twisty hallways of the Research Zone, Dumont stops abruptly and opens a door. Fumbling for a light switch inside, you hear him cursing under his breath, "Ah, here it is!" and the room is washed in light.

Inside there are mounds of books, magazines, popcorn, clustered around a massive wooden desk while across the room is a curtained area. Dumont sees you eyeing the curtain. "Shall we see what's behind curtain number three?" he asks you with a sly smile.

He pulls the curtain back briskly and a chill runs up your spine. There, amidst a tangle of wires, computers and a huge wall poster of the university's underground particle smashing cyclotron, sits a gleaming, black, human-shaped shell the size of a sports car. The lid is open.


"You see, it's quite simple. Particle physics isn't particle physics without human observation--it's just particles. So, when we insert one human, voila! Particle physics!" Dumont looks at you with a gleam in his dark blue eyes. "You're not taking notes?" he asks as he walks to a computer console.

Slowly, he fingers a few buttons while lost in some unfathomable thought processes, his gaze intent on the black shell. Luckily, he seems to be busy with things other than you.

Just as you start to think it might be prudent to find your way out through the labyrinthine hallways, he pulls up a lab stool for you to sit on. There is an intensity about him that rivets your attention. You can feel his excitement as he looks inside the black shell, checking wires that run along the inside.

"The shell is linked to the A.I. computer, which is linked to the cyclotron. The computer will learn from interacting with the human mind how to view the elusive particle which has escaped our detection so far--Particle X. Sort of a creative jump start, if you will," he says. "The computer just doesn't have the intelligence needed by itself."

Dumont sheds his coat and reaches for a white lab coat draped over a chair. "Now, the A.I. machine loads metaphors into the human brain for what is going on inside the cyclotron. And the human brain, being creative, tries to find meaning within the metaphors and, ultimately, views Particle X. Once that happens, the A.I. computer adjusts, learns, and becomes a particle viewing machine. And then, voila! The human can go home and get some sleep!"

He pulls the lab coat on and excitedly jabs a few buttons on the computer. "Then, you ask, what must it be like inside the shell, linked to a metaphor of the sub-atomic world?" You weren't even thinking of asking that. You were thinking of asking if you could transfer into another physics class. Any other physics class. "Now that's the interesting part," he continues. "I did most of the programming for P.A.R.T.I. myself--Particle Accelerator and Reality Translation Integrator.'


Dr. Dumont begins to pick up speed as he talks, whisking you and your imagination along with him. He grabs the lapels of his own lab coat as if to shake himself. "There's a shortcut to genius inside of P.A.R.T.I. somewhere, but you know I'm afraid the metaphors will be too personal for just anybody to make sense of them, too much of my own personality, my likes and dislikes."

He shakes his head, "But who knows?!! They won't let me try it out! I could be the first human to experience sub-atomic life, but do they give me that honor? Nooooo!" Dumont gestures wildly as he talks. "They've decided to train a subonaut, someone who will be groomed for the mission."

He throws back his mane of wild hair and laughs. "Subonaut! Sheesh!" He paces across the room then turns to you. "The experience will take only a few moments, but it won't feel that way to the person inside the shell. Time will be suspended and drawn out, rather dramatically I suspect."


Dr. Dumont leans forward, peers at you as if to see whether you've taken it all in, then steps over to the shell. He adjusts a wire inside the shell.

"If I could just make a few adjustments, but the darn subonaut hasn't been selected yet..."

He turns his piercing blue gaze on you, "Would you mind? Getting in the shell I mean? Just for a moment? I only need the physical dimensions of a body, yours will do fine," he says happily, gesturing to the awaiting interior.

You look at the black acrylic shell, not so chilling as when you first laid eyes on it. Dumont seems so intent on adjusting those wires in the shell, you feel compelled to help him out. Maybe this will even boost your grade, you speculate, as you slide into the contours of its inner dimensions. Dumont reaches over you to bring down the biolink electrodes, attaching the small wired disks to your temples, your arms, torso, and legs.

"Now, where did I put that screwdriver?" Dumont ruminates, as he disappears out of sight for a second.

The second draws out. You get fidgety. You hear the deep thrumming of the particle accelerator, feel its vibrations through the shell. Dumont doesn't seem to be returning. As you pull yourself up for a peek, your hand hits something along the outer edge of the shell and you hear an ominous click. The black shell quickly begins to close as you get a glimpse of Dumont running across the room shouting, "Oh my Gosh! Stop! Wait!" and then the shell lid clicks securely shut.

The last thing you hear is Dumont shouting, "This isn't going to get you an A, you know!" before you black out.

Bedroom


You're in a bedroom. Everything about this room seems normal on one level and yet oddly different on another. A quick scan around the room makes you ill-at-ease, as if you don't belong here. Or perhaps the room itself doesn't belong anywhere. A dresser complete with a mirror lies off to one side, against a white, featureless wall. A door is off to the west while to the south, through a doorway, you can see what must be a small bathroom.

=== enter.z5 (v5) ===


 "Another thrilling day at Neil Armstrong Middle and Elementary School," you think, with studied irony, as you get off the bus, trying to look as cool and bored as the other eighth graders. In truth, though, you really are a little excited and nervous, because today is Valentine's Day, and you have a special job to do, delivering Enterprise Candy Grams to classes all around the building. And best (and worst) of all, your delivery partner will be Judy, on whom you've had an incredible crush since before you knew what a crush was.

You are Doug DeGrace, a lanky, thirteen-year old eighth grade student at the only public school in Nom de Plume, North Dakota, a town of five thousand souls in the north central part of the United States, which boasts of being "The Coldest French-Named Town in the EN-tire US of A." Today's temperature does nothing to contradict the town's unofficial slogan.

As you enter the middle school side of the building, which is totally separate from the section for kids younger than ten, you see a huge red poster advertising the biggest social event of the year, the Valentine's Day Dance. The dance is tonight, but you're not at all sure you'll be going. After a quick trip to your locker, you arrive at the middle school cafeteria, where your school day starts.

The Cafe


The Neil Armstrong Middle and Elementary School Cafeteria is a big, unadorned room that echoes like Carlsbad Caverns whenever there's any noise at all, though it's quiet here now.  There's an exit to the west; and a door to the north leads to the Enterprise closet, where materials for your special task of the day are stored.


Mr. Alltext enters the cafeteria from the west.  He's a small man in his fifties and is wearing a "Save the Children" tie. 

"Hi!," he says. "It's good to see you're all on time. Here's the key to the closet, Doug." He gives you a brass key. "Judy will be working with you, and so will the new girl who's joining us today.

"Since you worked as a record keeper on our last candy gram project and Judy handled the actual deliveries, the two of you will swap those roles today.  The new girl will serve mainly as an observer.

"All the paperwork you'll need is on the shelf in the closet.  So are the cards and candy pops you'll be delivering. By the way, there are some unsold pops in the envelope.  Feel free to buy and deliver them, if you like."

"Any questions about your job today?"

Judy flops herself down on one of the cafeteria stools.  She's blond and pretty, and she's chewing a big wad of gum.

The new girl is known by the odd nickname "Queenie," or so you've been told.  She approaches you and Judy, limping a little. She seems quiet, but not especially shy or nervous. Queenie has a small scar on her cheek. 

Judy raises her hand, even though only three students are in the area.  Mr. Alltext replies a bit ruefully, as if he's expecting something odd, "Yes, Judy."

"Can I go the bathroom?" Judy inquires. 

Mr. Alltext pauses, collects himself for a moment, and replies, "I don't think that qualifies as a question about our special task for today, Judy, but I'll answer anyway. No. You may not. However, in a few minutes, you'll be on your own (Heaven help us!), delivering the candy grams, and so you'll be able to make your own hygienic choices."

"OK," she comments amiably.

Smoke pillars rise from the landscape like ghostly skyscrapers while debris-filled craters mark every visible portion of land. Fires pollute the air and ashes drift like schools of dead fish. Bones, still holding flesh as if they might yet be resurrected, lie about in numbers beyond comprehension.

The disaster was swift and the destruction wholesale.

You stand alone, face disfigured, hips bent to the left, innards exposed on your arms, legs, and abdomen. The enemy has moved on, swiftly destroying the entire planet. 

You stare through blue, mechanical eyes, methodically traversing your surroundings, hoping to find some sign that you did not completely fail.

Lost Battlefield


In all directions the land is a waste. Craters, bones, flesh  smoke litter the entire landscape while ashen clouds form dark and foreboding shapes in an angry red sky. The earth trembles from dislocated tectonic plates and the atmosphere is quickly becoming unbreathable and unlivable. A smoking forest can be seen to the west, a large steel-gray city is burning to the north, and the edge of an enormous smoldering crater lies to the east.

Eric The Power-Mad Dungeon Master
by Mark Arenz
(c) 2004


[9:38pm on a Saturday in 1981.  D&D night at Eric's]



Long ago ... in the time of Arbaldu, lord of the short forest- or something like that-

Josh: Can we just get on with this?

Everybody shut the hell up!  This is how things go every time I DM, and I'm sick of it.  You guys seem to think you can back-sass the Dungeon Master and get away with it.   Well, just remember that I have the power to smite you all at will.

Brad: You keep saying that, Eric, but I'm not convinced that you know what it means.

My finger is on the smiting button right now.  Don't test me.

As we sew the tapestry of our lives, we work with only one thread at a time.  Some are bright, some dark, some with colors we can't quite describe.

At the moment, you are working with one particularly dull, frayed thread, and one sorry excuse for a needle.  The events of the past year are immaterial right now.  All you know is that "home" is not what it used to mean, and this is not where you want to be.

If you could just get away... even for an hour or two.

Living Room


This is the cultural center of apartment F209.  Its true symbolic magnificence is once again belied by its current squalid nature.  You wonder for a while how anyone could actually live in a place like this, until you remember that you pay the rent here.  The endless white of the undecorated walls is interrupted only by a hallway to the south, the kitchen to the east, and the front door to the north.




A large, selfish cat stares at you impatiently.




The front door is closed, displaying its chipped, off-white countenance with pride.

=== fantasydimension.z3 (v3) ===
You find yourself standing in a small airlock, the sound of rushing air filling your ears. The walls around you are smooth and metallic, and the only light comes from a small panel on the far side of the room. As you approach it, the panel beeps and a message appears on the screen.

"Welcome to the Airlock," it reads. "This facility is designed to protect against the harmful effects of interdimensional travel. Please wait for the pressure to equalize before proceeding."

As you stand there, you realize that you have no idea how you got here. The last thing you remember was sitting at your desk, working hard on a project. But now, you're in some sort of high-tech airlock, and you can feel the pressure slowly equalizing around you.

After a few moments, the panel beeps again, and you hear a voice through a speaker above the screen. "Please state your intended destination."

You pause for a moment, trying to think of what to say. You're not even sure where you are, let alone where you want to go.

"Umm, home, I guess?" you say tentatively.

There's a brief pause, and then the voice speaks again. "I'm sorry, but we are unable to comply with that request. This facility is for interdimensional travel only. Please state your desired dimension."

You frown, feeling a bit frustrated. What the hell is going on? But then, an idea occurs to you.

"Fantasy world," you say decisively.

There's a moment of silence, and then the voice speaks again. "Very well. Initiating interdimensional travel sequence. Please stand by."

You feel a sudden jolt, and the airlock begins to vibrate around you. Then, with a hiss of escaping air, the door on the other side of the room slides open.

Airlock


The airlock is a small, metallic chamber, with smooth walls that seem to be made of some sort of advanced alloy. The only source of light is a small panel on the far side of the room, which is displaying information about the airlock and its purpose.

As you look around, you notice that there are two doors leading out of the chamber. The inner door, closest to you, is closed, and appears to lead back to your home dimension. It's made of the same material as the walls. The outer door, which is on the far side of the chamber, is open and reveals a breathtaking view of the world beyond. You can see rolling hills, dense forests, and towering mountains in the distance, and the air around the doorway is filled with the scent of flowers.

Summer on a college campus is rarely exciting, and this year is no exception. Your fellow students won't be returning for three more weeks, and the endless grind of your job at the computer center is not anyone's idea of entertainment.

Yesterday was the first of September, and autumn is moving in. But the long drag of classes won't start for weeks. Restless would be one way to describe your mood; bored sick would be another.

Last night, you had odd dreams: a circle, turning endlessly, and carrying you on its back across strange lands; yourself grown double, and dueling with cold-blazing swords; and others, stranger yet.

Then the alarm went off, and you emerged into another mundane day. Maybe something will come along to entertain you....

=== gaucho.z5 (v5) ===









The tour had been going exceedingly well up to this point. You've always yearned to visit a Ghost Town and your affection for the Old West has never been stronger. It stemmed from your early years of playing Cowboys and Indians with the neighborhood gang. When the opportunity came up, this was a no-miss trip! A remote town on the old Texas-Mexico border that has been left untouched and well-preserved in the arid climate for more than a century. This is exactly the vacation that you have craved! At one time, this place was a bustling little frontier town of notable repute. Nameless now, the town was once filled with frontiersmen. "Gauchos" the underpaid South American tour guide kept calling them. Cowboys by any other name. It doesn't matter what nationality a cowboy is, he remains an icon and a legend. You couldn't wait to get here - when you logged out of the Geek and set your Facebook status to 'On Vacation', you were going totally tech-free, just like the pioneers did. Even more special is that this particular no-name town was founded by none other than General Jebbidiah Alden in 1865. A Civil War hero who made it his mission in life to help rebuild after the destruction caused by the war. General Alden was well-liked and well-respected. History remembers him kindly. His descendants still live only a few hundred miles from the site of this now long-abandoned ghost town. Unfortunately, your allergies have kicked in at the worst possible time. Before long the tour guide was speaking but all you could concentrate on was the stuffiness in your head. Breathing became a labor and staying alert a chore. If you could just rest your head for a few minutes... It wasn't exactly clear when you fell asleep, but the tour guide and your fellow tourists have moved on without you. The last thing you can remember is the tour guide saying that the group could take a short break for lunch, take a last look around and then get back on the bus for the trip home. As you wake up, you can hear the clunker of a bus pull out of the parking lot to the north. 

Welcome to Gaucho! Your goal is to survive one (1) night here in this ghost town so you can be picked up by the next tour bus that will arrive in the morning. With your allergies acting up, you'll need a good night's sleep to make it through. And you are so thirsty that you'll never be able to sleep without a good long chug of water. To survive in this old frontier town, you will need all of your wits to combat puzzles and obstacles that stand in your way. As you progress, you will uncover various special items and, quite possibly, some gold. At the end of your adventure (if you either Win or Quit), you will be given a unique code that you can use on the Geek to claim special microbadges and geekgold. At any time during the game, you can type SCORE to see your progress. If you wish to give up and simply claim your earned prizes, you can type QUIT. If you win the game, it will be obvious as to how to claim your prizes. The maximum score for this game is 100. If you need a bit of generic help, type HELP. Good luck!

Secluded Alley


You are standing in a secluded alley. The sun is mostly shielded by the buildings to either side and to the south. To the north, you see the road and parking lot where the bus had previously been. Behind you is a thick wall, with a nice soft pile of dirt to nap on. But now that the wind is picking up, blowing straight into the alley, you doubt that you'd be able to sleep there anymore!

You were celebrating the arrival of the not-quite-second-half of the 21st century with your buddies in your gaming basement when the bad news arrived: Crazy Uncle Scott had finally given up the good fight and passed off into gaming nirvana. He was an unusual man, with a firm belief that the world went to hell in a hand-basket with the arrival of text messages, always claiming that their phones were smarter than them! So he bought himself a huge mansion and spent his last days there pining for the glory days of yore, when websites were nothing more than acres of bright blue links thrown willy-nilly onto a computer screen.

Somehow, though, he took a shine to you, and you were smart enough to hide your smartphone whenever he came calling. Nevertheless, it was quite a surprise to learn that he left you exactly half his will. And even more of a surprise to discover that the lawyer's language was precise: not half his massive fortune in Geekgold, but literally half his will. Along with a short note explaining that to collect your full inheritance, you must retrieve the second half of Crazy Uncle Scott's will from his old estate, Alden Manor. The very name brings chills to your spine: that place is haunted!

But the true horror lay in the closing passage of the note:

Leave your Smartphone at home!

At the Front Gate


And so it stands before you, a house that could have been cozy, if not for the peeling blue paint, the flying gargoyles encircling the roof, and the looming twelve-foot tall fence with 'WARNING: Electrified' painted in blood red letters. The yard on this side of the fence continues to the east and west. The main gate, dutifully keeping you out of Alden Manor proper, lies directly to the north. If you wish to give up on this grand adventure, there is a path leading south back to civilization.

You are standing in a forest.

Dense rows of gnarled trees stretch as far as you can see. Dead leaves litter the damp ground. The air is still and cold.

Gazing to the north, you sense more than see the looming mass of GHOST MOUNTAIN.

I'm a nineteen year old blonde bombshell and I'm on my way back from yet another crazy art school party. It's about five AM and the sun's already up, as are the birds, who are doing their level best to aggravate my hangover with their bloody singing! I could really use something to eat and somewhere to sleep off this hangover, but something tells me I shouldn't have taken this shortcut through the forest. I have a really baaad feeling about it...

In the enchanted forest


A large wooden sign informs me that I'm in the Enchanted Forest. What it doesn't tell me is how the hell I get out! Everywhere I look there are trees, trees, trees. This place definately has a 'tree' theme going. A clearly marked path leads south and west, whilst in every other direction are, well, trees.

=== gsdemo.z8 (v8) ===


A bead of sweat rolls down your cheek as you steel yourself for the task at hand.  Gripping the steering wheel of your car tightly, you shift the idling car into drive and floor the gas pedal as you sharply twist the wheel to the left.  Your car obediently careens to the left rocketing past a brown wooden sign marked "Greystone Psychiatric Hospital".

Your car roars through the still night air as you hurtle towards an ominous and colossal building with a tower jutting towards the star-filled sky.  Sweating profusely as you ponder your future in that dark place, you swerve your car into two parking spaces, slamming on the brakes effecting the horrendous skidding noise you were hoping for.  Flinging open the door to your car you stumble out and towards the large double doors to the facility.  Staggering over to the counter you loudly announce the fact you are suicidal but that you don't want to die.

Within seconds, two orderlies rush over slide you into a wheelchair as a nurse consults her clipboard, efficiently asking you several questions about yourself. After the lengthy Q&A session, there is an extensive screening process. Finally, you are wheeled directly to a private room where the orderlies confiscate all of your belongings, methodically search them and hand you a simple hospital gown to wear.  Your visit to Greystone has begun.


The Greystone Test Drive lets you explore a section of the main building and some of the grounds. Also, you can interact with some of the patients, a staff member and even your own assistant, a state trooper. In the full, unrestricted version of Greystone the entire story is open to you.

Your Room


Dreary takes on new meaning as your eyes wander over the chipping paint on the walls of your small, dimly lit room.


Sparsely furnished with a single bed, a plain nightstand and an equally plain dresser and little else, you don't half wonder why more people don't crazy while in Greystone's care.  A darkened doorway leads west while a hallway is north.

Life on Gue Street.


I highly suggest typing "About" if this is your first time playing this.


The little, invaluable self-deceptions we allow ourselves. Sometimes they're the only things that make adventuring bearable. Today, for example, you're taking a walk on Gue Street beneath a cloudless summer sky. Not surprising; you've been adventuring around this neighborhood almost every day to enjoy the warm weather and plentiful treasure. You've walked down this street, and dozens identical to it all across Quendor, countless times, reveling in the little details, taking an adventurer's pleasure in noting how the whole architecture of the game seems to change based on what you type. The placement of a single "N" or "Kill Troll" or the calibrated timing of a child's laugh, the most random of events, combine like a catalyst with your emotions such that the street never appears quite the same. It is therefore completely plausible, you tell yourself repeatedly, that this is just another daily adventure, that there's no special reason why you turned down this tiny lane rather than the next one. The fact that the White House, the unjustly enticing old, boarded up, cozy, bungalow is just down the street is a mere coincidence, nothing more.


 Type "1" to continue, "2" to turn back, or "No" to take a different path.

Your looking for a job. 'Boss' as you know him as, picked you up one day and asked you if you wanted one. It was about murder, and you were scared at first, but when he offered you five hundred thousand bucks you told him you would take the risk. The car stopped at about seven o'c, and you got out, the gun's cold metal touching your hip. You began walking, thinking of what you are about to do...

Corner Of Zen Street

=== hangar_22.z5 (v5) ===



It is the hottest summer of all time (or at least it feels that way now that your electricity has been cut off). Your lack of employment has finally caught up with you. Your funds have been depleted and your pockets are empty. Last month's essentials (cable television and Internet access) are now but sweet memories. The lack of air conditioning feels like the final straw. You were really hoping to starve to death at a comfortable 68 degrees.

Yesterday for lunch you boiled and ate two hot dog wieners. For dinner, you drank the water you boiled them in. (Mmm, "Hot Dog Soup".) So far your dignity has kept you from rummaging through trash cans for food, but it's starting to sound like a viable option. Just the thought of sinking your teeth into someone else's left over pizza crust makes your mouth water.

The current economy has made it hell for a spoiled, out-of-work computer programmer such as yourself to find work.  It wasn't too long ago that a five-figure salary seemed beneath you; today, given your current state of affairs, you would accept four. It's time to find a job and find some food, and find them today.

Living Room


While your living room isn't much to look at, you call it home. Back when you were working 80 hours a week, you had no time to fix the place up. Now that you have all the time in the world, you have no money. Even in hard times, you retain your sense of irony. Your ratty couch sits along one wall, facing your cheap (and empty) entertainment center. The front door of your home is to the NORTH. Your dining room lies WEST, and your bedroom is to the SOUTH.


(First time playing Hangar 22? Type ABOUT. Need a list of common commands? Type COMMANDS.)




Your front door is closed, which prevents people outside from coming in, and vice versa (it's called physics).

The place where Sirius hid out, watching over Harry, and where that Rita lady scrounged up all the lies for her Daily Prophet articles. Too bad it's a little too dark for you to see everything, though. Can you believe it? You're almost there! Almost at Hogwarts! The excitement is coursing through your veins!

Deep in the Forest


Perpetually misty and haunted, the forest is a scary place in your mind. In fact, it's also quite disorienting. As you walk in and look at the huge, huge trees with their big trunks and dark wood, you lose all sense of direction and don't even know which way you entered from.




"C'mon everyone," says a gruff voice. "All first years over here, please." You look over and up. And up some more. That must be Hagrid, the huge, scary-looking grizzly groundskeeper, with wild, long, dark hair and a fierce, weathered face. You start to feel slightly afraid, but then you see Hagrid smile a huge smile, shout "Harry!" and run towards a boy with glasses and dark hair, with what looks to be a scar on his forehead, giving him a huge hug. That must be Harry Potter, the boy who survived, who you've heard so much about! What a hero! Standing up to You-Know-Who not just once, but time and time again. Maybe you'll be able to meet him!

"This is the house, miss," the man from the town says, stopping a good few yards from the gate. Even as you thank him, he is walking briskly away - shoulders hunched, hands in pockets - and he does not turn around to answer you. 





 You peer through the wrought-iron curlicues of the gate and wonder if there has been some mistake. This house hardly looks inhabited. All its windows are dark. Its paint, whatever color it once was, has faded to a dull greyish shade. The posts of the porch railing are broken and jagged, leaning at odd angles like a mouthful of crooked teeth. Can this really be the home of your new employer? 





 Well, you should at least go up to the house and look. You've come all this way, after all. 





 You step through the gate. It creaks shut behind you.

Front Lawn


The tall, browning grass rustles in the chill wind, but there don't seem to be any flowers to bring a bit of color to the grey surroundings. A cobbled path cuts a narrow slice through the overgrown lawn, leading north to the house, and another path, branching off of that one, leads around the side of the house to the northwest. To the south looms the front gate.

"I'm sorry, Mother. I know this isn't the career you wanted for me. But it's something I believe in. I consider it a great opportunity and one I can't pass up."

A silver-haired woman in her later years stands before you with her hands shaking and her eyes in tears. "I know, Jake. I know. You've always made good decisions, and I'm proud of you no matter what. It's just... so very dangerous. I'm worried. Why did you have to sign on with... with..."

You reach out in a feeble attempt to comfort your mother, but the vision fades as it always does in this dream. Never a second opportunity, never another chance to make things right before...

"Breeeeet... Breeeeet... Level 5 Emergency... Level 5 Emergency. Cryogenic pods activated. Hull Temperature now at critical. Guidance System damaged. Main Deflectors destroyed. Descent proceeding on last known trajectory..."

Your hearing is always the first to respond after waking from cryogenic hibernation. A few seconds later the other senses begin to thaw and your eyes regain some level of focus. Normally the first thing you would see is the soft glow of the overhead cabin lights. This time, however, your senses are greeted by unfamiliar and harsh stimuli. The tremendous light and heat, bearing down with the intensity of a hundred suns, don't allow your eyes to open for more than an instant. The grating noise all around you builds to a fevered pitch as it drowns out the automated warnings.

A few seconds later comes a thunderous boom, followed by darkness, and finally silence.

When you regain consciousness you are in possession of the single worst headache you can remember. Granted, this is the 
only
 headache you can remember having. Other than the bump on your head, you can vaguely remember a dream of your mother... and very little else...

Cryotube


You are lying prone on the inside of an all black cylinder. This area is cramped with only a minimum of room to move about. You see a small sensor panel located on the inside of the cylinder. 
Directly above you is a small window set into the frame of the tube. The cryotube is currently closed.

=== ill.z5 (v5) ===


I didn't take it seriously when the wretched old woman read my fortune and told me I would die on this date. Why should I have? 

Just because she's been right about everything else? 

But it is different now. Because it turns out it's not just me, it's everyone.  Like the banner above the window says: 

WELCOME TO THE END OF THE WORLD. 

The prophecies have come true, one by one.  The earthquakes, the eruptions, the sun turning red. And they've accelerated; the final three all came yesterday, so there is no denying it. Even the most skeptical today are mute, with leaden faces. 

But even in my last hours, or perhaps last minutes, I am not scared. I will occupy my time with activity, for what else is there to do?

Monotrain station


I stand inside the monotrain station, on the balcony beside the window looking out over the city. A train is ready to depart; the conductor hollers out a final call for passengers, but the few remaining people ignore her. The door into the ticket booth is closed, but I can always just go back out of the station.



I consider what to do.

I'll... 

=== inhumane.z5 (v5) ===




You awaken in your tent, lying on the floor, with a hangover like you wouldn't believe. As you lever yourself up, you notice that there is complete silence instead of the usual morning complaints 
of the workers and Roboff's usual shouting. This can only mean one thing - Roboff must have finally run off on you. Panicked, you look around and see your amulet lying on the floor. At least 
Roboff had the sense to not trigger off your alarm. Knowing him, he also had the sense to take the emergency radio. How the megakrip are you going to get out of this one?

"Is this alright?" asks the young cop. "Do you need the lights lower, or incense, or something?"

"This is fine. I just need to see him, ask some questions."

"Okay," he nods. "Just buzz the buzzer when you're done." He leaves, pulling the metal door to with the click of a magnetic lock. Across the table from you the man stiffens, waiting for you to speak.

Interview Room


The six walls are metal. This is a box in which nothing happens but people talk, and fans whir air in and out to help the words move along. By the door in the north wall is a small red button that rings the buzzer for the guard, and it's smart enough to know who's pushing. This isn't a place people leave of their own accord, and they rarely come here that way either.



The man across the table from you is no different. His eyes are sagging from lack of sleep, and he is sweating just a little even though the air is regulated to be cold.

=== invisible.z8 (v8) ===






You've always been an outsider. At school, being interested in science, the other students didn't want to have anything to do with you. The other boys laughed at you, the girls despised you. Your parents didn't understand you. And even your teachers were so far below your intellectual level that you couldn't have a serious conversation with them! This went so far that you always got bad grades, although you were smarter than everybody else - your stupid teachers simply never saw it.




Now, after years of restless private scientific research, you've finally achieved your goal: You've found the secret of invisibility. Everyone at work (you don't know any people outside work) said you were mad when you announced your plans... especially your boss who just laughed and said a lowly research assistant working at a second-rate university would never be able to do it. He only hired you to do the most stupid, repetitive and primitive of work, after all. Most of the day, you're forced to clean test tubes. Nobody has ever recognised your genius! Now you've proven them all wrong - and you'll have your revenge on them! Yes, revenge... the only thing you can think of right now. Revenge. Revenge! REVENGE!

After the magical wall was erected around the kingdom, the cost of farm labor skyrocketed as workers from the enchanted forest and fairy prairie were no longer able to cross the border to find jobs. You and your mom were squeaking by until she became sick. Unable to afford insurance, you have had to sell off your assets one by one to keep the farm going.




Now you are down to your final cow, good old Bessy.

Fifth Layer of the Earth's Crust


Endless dark and foreboding passages surround you on all sides. You're cold, tired, and that musty smell in the air has really started getting to you lately. Spelunking seemed much more romantic when you first agreed to accept the mission for the Jewel. Untold riches, fame, glory; it seemed so perfect. Now you're a month into the expedition with little to show for it except for a few rock samples and the death of a party member. You're deep inside the fifth layer of the Earth's crust, surrounded by tight shafts and ominous pits. You are quickly descending to the sixth and final layer; the resting place of the fabled Jewel.




Your good friend and fellow campaigner Jacob is here. He slowly scuttles through the underground by your side.

=== karn.z5 (v5) ===





A Galactic servant, that's what you feel like at the moment.  You'd think that the Timelords would be pleased that you were not only responsible for discovering that Morbius' brain had been secretly kept alive, but that you were instrumental in destroying the revived villian.  Do they offer you their gratitude?  No, they merely point out that you left the Brain of Morbius on Karn and demand that you retrieve it and bring it back to Gallifrey.  That's gratitude for you.

However, as you value your own freedom, you really don't have much choice but to do as the Timelords request.  At least they gave you the coordinates for Karn, but you did notice that they refused to give you return coordinates for Gallifrey, saying you'd receive them once you'd procured the brain.  So much for Gallifreyan hospitality...

Your thoughts are interrupted as you hear a familiar thud.  The TARDIS has landed on Karn.

You've awakened to the waves rocking a small rowboat that you are seated on. The blazing sun hides your view in a white flash for a moment, then you can see.


Your arms are chained to your back, and you can still small the strong drugs that were forced under your breath.


All this happened with a walk down the shore of the beach, now far, when a rough hand pushed a damp napkin against your nose. Before you could react, you remember your eyes flickering shut.


All you saw was pure darkness. Now you need to find a way to escape.

Nobody told you stardom would be this boring. You thought the five-year wait just to get into the sky was bad, but at least you had an earth to occupy yourself with, humans doddering around like flies - rather amusing flies. You haven't seen humans on the moon in forever. You've seen nothing, in fact, but the same dull rocks in the same musty craters, and the stars who made it to the sky saying don't worry, it'll be your turn soon, everyone gets their chance, stay pretty, you should really shine more.




You have to admit, though, he was right. Your turn came. A leap second, your time to plunge off this rock into their sky, stop clocks, fulfill a few wishes if you must, and dazzle everyone who watches - that, or miss the landing and live the rest of your life swaddled by a cold ocean. Your debut: all the stars do it.




The sky is cold. Midnight is soon. Leap time.

Well, it's private, at least. They assured you of this. It's a crumbly gray hole dug into a gray field, yes, and the air's choked with dust.

Even if someone down below were to look at the sky when you were out of your trench, they'd merely see a shiny speck. Windows get them all the time

The warm summer rain paints a pattern on the vespertine pavements of Rome. I'm in my shower while large drops of rain aggressively knock against the window, just to join with their siblings to form a rill.

I think of 
them
. Each of them was so special. The delicate fingers pressing against the indestructible window pane which was supposed to keep evil out. The superior attitude suddenly giving way to despair. The widening eyes in the moment of cognition. I step out of the shower and let go of the memory. My mouth line is twisted into a bitter smile. My skin is dry.

A Familiar Place


Everything here is just like it always is, except for that door.

A Familiar Place

=== loose.z5 (v5) ===



What was that?


You freeze, all your senses on alert. Not mineral. Not vegetable, either. That means...animal? Your eyes scan the countryside, swiveling like searchlights, and pause briefly on a grove of trees to the north.


"No, not there! Up here!" guides a voice edged with impatience. As you whirl around, peering up, you squint and shield your eyes against the sun's glare. Waving at you from the top of a rickety wooden fence is a well-groomed egg, who confesses, "I could use a bit of help, if you don't mind."


After a long and rather awkward silence, the egg mutters, "It's very rude to stare, you know. When I was your age, children were taught to respect their elders, not gawk at them as if they were animals in a zoo." The egg crosses his legs, folds his arms and pretends to ignore you.

Everything here is white. Somehow, you know that, even before you raise your head from your crouched position on the floor. As you cautiously look around, your clearest and most pressing sense is that you feel out of breath and exhilarated - and you're not supposed to feel like that, you're supposed to be resting, you promised you'd rest - but here you are anyway. You're certain you've never seen this place, but it's too familiar for comfort.

You must have been here before.

You were looking for a birthday present for your niece Isabelle, that was it. The toy stores along Regent Street were blaring out pop music and the window displays were garish scenes of animated computer violence. But down a dim Victorian arcade you came across a different kind of toyshop, with a peeling rocking-horse behind a grimy window. Perhaps in here, you thought...

The letter from the solicitor didn't tell you much about the house that you've inherited, other than its location. Now, after a long and tedious journey across some of England's most remote countryside, you've finally arrived. You're surprised by the size of the place; evidently your great aunt was more wealthy than you ever suspected.

As the taxi disappears back the way it came, you take the key from your bag and turn to look at your new home...

=== medusa.z5 (v5) ===






It took you a little time to get your vampire costume together, so you've been running late for Gary's costume party.  You've arrived now on the ground floor of his high-rise apartment building.  Better late than never as they say.  

The elevator makes a soft jingle as it opens and you step into the mirrored interior.  For a moment you think, struggling to remember Gary's floor number...  Oh yes, you remember now, 
15
.  You reach out and push the appropriate button.  The doors begin to close but stop suddenly as a slender hand appears.  There's another jingle and the doors open again revealing a beautiful, red-headed girl dressed in a toga.  

You recognize her from campus although you do not actually know her.  For a moment you almost do not see the red rubber snakes entwined with her long red curls.  She steps into the elevator and reaches for a button, but stops, apparently seeing that it is already lit.  


It seems,
 you think as the doors close and the elevator begins to move, 
that this "Medusa" is going to same costume party that you are.

Elevator


An elevator; pretty much like any other elevator you've ever been in. Your increased weight conveys the sensation of movement and the floor indicator above the closed doors changes as the elevator passes floors. Next to the elevator doors, several dozen buttons are arranged in two rows.

All the walls in this elevator are mirrored and exhibit a matrix of identical vampires and gorgons stretching to infinity in all directions.




A slender, red headed girl dressed as Medusa stands beside you.  Her reflections surround you in all directions.

Your daughter Crystal has recently become ill, but you do not know why. It is obvious to you that if she isn't cured soon she will die. You have heard stories about a magical plant which grows somewhere around this region, but you have never actually seen it. It is said to be able to cure any illness. You must set off to find it. It is your only chance to save your daughter.

Small Cottage


This is your home. A small cottage that you built for you and your daughter. Made from the wood of the surrounding trees, it blends in very well with the surroundings. The room is not well furnished. There is just a table, an old stove and two beds. In one of the beds lies your daughter, Crystal. Set in the south wall of the cottage is a small square window. 

 Exits: Exit.

Mines


Copyright (c) 1979, 2005-2009 James L. Dean


Version 2010.10.29 released October 29, 2010


This z-machine program may be distributed or used without payment to its author. Derivative works must credit its author.


"Mines" lets you explore mines. The mine you explore is determined by a mine number specified at the beginning of a game.


The object of a game is to visit all of the rooms and return all of the treasures to the entrance without making too many moves.


In a mine, the passages are straight. So, for example, if you go North to leave a room, you can go South to reenter 
it. The rooms are not evenly spaced. However, the distance between adjacent rooms is always a multiple of the minimum 
distance between adjacent rooms.


Commands in the game are "N", "E", "S", "W", "U", and "D" to move North, East, 
South, West, Up, or Down, respectively. Other commands are "C" to carry 
things, "I" to inventory what you are carrying, "L" to leave treasures, "P" to 
get the points you've scored, "O" for help getting out of the mine, "H" for 
help, and "Q" to quit.

Bedroom
 (on

Here you spend your sleeping hours. 
Margaret
 was, just like for the rest of the house, responsible for decorating and arranging the room when you moved in. Without a doubt, she did this with her very own eye for detail. Once or twice, she hinted that you have been insufficiently appreciative of this. Maybe, but you do recognize the things of real practical value, like the calendar on the wall, at least!

Next to the bed, there is a nightstand. You can enter the living room from here. Because you are not using the second door, located opposite to the window, you have decided to place the wardrobe right in front of it
.




On the nightstand, you can see your wallet.

=== mystery-of-winchester-high.z5 (v5) ===


Frederick H Winchester III was a rich man who lived in the city of Dunedin in New Zealand. Winchester's grandfather was an Englishman who emigrated to New Zealand in the early 1800s and became very wealthy as an importer/exporter. The grandfather's business was passed down the family line to Winchester's father, then to Winchester himself, along with the company's wealth.

Winchester's wife was Scottish, as were most of the immigrants in Dunedin, but she died of consumption (known nowadays as tuberculosis) at an early age, and the couple never had any children. Winchester never remarried and regretted having no children of his own. As a consequence, when he retired, he became a philanthropist and donated thousands of pounds to children's charities, particularly those that supported the education of Maori children, as he had great admiration for the Maori people and their culture.

Frederick H Winchester III died on 30 April 1932. His mansion was willed to the city of Dunedin to be turned into a high school. The school was named Winchester High in honour of its benefactor. Apart from the mansion, the remainder of Winchester's vast fortune was never found and its whereabouts became known as The Mystery of Winchester High.

Years have passed and the school is now running into financial difficulties. If the school's principal cannot obtain funding, she will have to close the school.

As a student at the school, you didn't really care about the school closing, until your teacher happened to mention that all the students will be transferred to a worse school if funding is not found. With that revelation, you decide to solve the mystery and find Winchester's lost fortune.

It's rumoured that when the mansion was converted into a school, some parts of the former mansion were not used. You wonder whether the fortune could be found there...


[You're about to embark on an adventure. You can move around, examine things and manipulate things by typing simple text commands of one or more words, usually starting with a verb. The tutorial will offer suggestions to get you started. Commands in the tutorial are shown in upper case, but you can enter them in lower case, if you prefer.

This isn't happening, it really isn't.  You were just about to finish up a two week probationary period as a site operator at the University computer center on the third floor of Hodges Hall.  It was a quiet night, you were working on that interactive fiction game, nobody around...and then you saw a shadow out of the corner of your eye.  And one of the laser printers is gone.  Unless it's back before 7am, this job - the one you were 
counting on 
to pay your tuition next semester - is, shall we say, history.  You sigh.  It's not going to be just another...

It is time for your weekly Go lesson. You have been coming to your teacher's home for the past six months and though she isn't extravagant with her praise, you feel that your game is improving. 

Smiling inwardly, you remember your teacher's words the last time you called Go a 'game'. "A 'game'!" she said. "Go is not just a game - it is a reflection of your inner self!" 

But you sense that something is wrong: your teacher doesn't answer your knock, and in fact the front door is unlocked. Curious, you step inside...

Living Room


The living room is tastefully decorated. The furniture is arranged to make maximum use of the limited space. A bookshelf 
takes up one wall, while a sofa and end table are pushed up against another. Directly across from the sofa is a television.

On your last visit, a large wooden Go board occupied the space between the sofa and the TV, but now it's missing. The only thing left in its place are a pair of wooden Go bowls.

The front door is to the north, the kitchen is east and the bedroom lies to the south.

Its ridiculously bright yellow light makes everyone in the room appear to be suffering from inttermittent jaundice.  Fortunately you're the only one in the room, because there's no room in here for anyone else.  The OKAY button is also buzzing, with the patented Elevated Responsiveness Tone guaranteed to remain irritating no matter how often one is forced to hear it.  Somehow the most annoying part, though, is that the blinking and the buzzing are slightly out of sync.

It's probably for the best (or worst?) that you gave money to a begging gypsy that one time, because now, you can travel between this realm a somewhat identical, parallel realm by saying "up" or "down." You're just that gifted, kid.  You've seen some strange things in the other world--your friends replaced with monsters, your things replaced with, uh, other things, and other strange ideas. You tried to tell this to your family, but they didn't believe you. Big mistake, my friend.

Now you're in a psych ward. You'd do anything to get out of this hellhole. Even the family that put you in wants you back - but the doctors keep diagnosing problems you know you don't have. The good news is that Maggie, the supervising nurse, won't notice you unless you go past her desk. The bad news is, well, you're not out yet.

But tonight is when you decided to make your getaway. Tomorrow's your big medical evaluation, and none other than Maggie, who's called you an "aggravating spider" just yesterday, is representing you. Why would you not escape?

Your Quarters


Rank certainly does have its privileges.  When you were a lowly lieutenant you had to share cramped quarters with a fellow lieutenant at your previous assignment.  Commanding a company of your own affords you the luxury of private, spacious quarters just outside the barracks themselves. As a further abuse of your power your chest and bunk are not standard issue items from the Pentari millitary supply center.

Town Square


Tasteful pastels and neons form a concrete square around an anomalous growth in the form of a large tree. The odd walls and spires surrounding give the impression of exits in many directions.




A chest has somehow managed to lodge itself in the tree's upper branches.




A cannon sits nearby.

Lost in the Fog.



A strange phosphorescent smoke covered the area, catching several hues from an unknown light source. A charge was in the air, as if lightning were about to strike. The hairs on the back of my neck were erect. I had this terrible feeling that at any moment someone would wander up and ask me to dance.

Piracy 2.0 - A Text Adventure in Space


by Sean Huxter 


Your shift began like most others as Captain of the United Worlds Guardian Class Patrol vessel, U.W.S. Ceres, a routine supply mission of no particular import, routine crew checks, signing this order, monitoring that communication, so it was not only a surprise, but an unexpected honor when your mentor, Admiral Copeland, contacted you by secure sub-etha channel to charge you with a highly sensitive mission. 

James Whitehall, perhaps this era's most renowned and reviled interstellar pirate, was cornered with his crew and captured yesterday out on the galactic rim, and he wasn't taken quietly. Though when the moment approached, Whitehall's crew bailed and fled in their tattered ship, abandoning their leader to the law. Under heavy guard, Whitehall was transported to the U.W.S. Orion, another Guardian Class ship, which was heavily damaged in the arrest operation. The Orion had to undergo immediate drydock repairs, but it was the only spaceworthy ship in the vicinity. 

Your mission was to rendezvous with the Orion and take charge of this deadly prisoner, allowing the Orion to get back to spacedock without further delay. 

The route you were instructed to take was a coded, randomly-generated series of course corrections which would have sent anyone trying to intercept you on a wild goose chase, as you were eventually to arrive and dock at Penal Satellite One, where Whitehall would be held until trial. 

You know the Admiral was putting some portion of his reputation on the line trusting you with this job, and you weren't about to let him down. 

But it didn't turn out that way. There must have been a leak somewhere, either on your ship or at United Worlds Command, because in an isolated sector of open space you were approached and attacked by a ramshackle pirate cruiser. 

The pirate crew had come for their leader. They made their intentions clear immediately, ordering you to heave to and be boarded. 

Of course you were not about to give up your prisoner without a fight, but their rag-tag ship, festooned with weapons, outgunned your ship's meager trio of laser cannons and its small crew. 

After an all-too-brief battle your ship was boarded, and as far as you know, your crew completely wiped out by the ruthless marauders. You wonder why you're still alive, guessing that your good fortune comes only due to the possibility you may yet be of some use to the pirates. 

Now, Whitehall, with a keycode for the Brig he must have tortured out of your Security Officer, escorts you personally to the cell and shoves you in. He laughs as the door locks behind you...

Brig


You're in a small, smooth-walled room with barely enough area to stand. A pair of simple bunk beds occupy most of the cramped space. There is a panel near the door. A faint smell of ozone is coming from the 
vent high above the beds. The pirates must have started some electrical fires. The only door is 
north
, but it's closed and locked.

Void: The Center


This is the center, apparently. The planes of existence stretch out around you; some open and beckoning, some blocked to your spirit. Most are esoteric and of little importance to you, but you are drawn to several: the physical, or 
literal
 plane; the plane of 
structure
; the plane of 
shape
; and the plane of 
essence
.

This place seems to revolve around a multi-dimensional object, a 
monolith
 which seems to continue through all the planes. Your sight cannot penetrate it.

At the Show


You're in a dark, poorly lit and packed club. Everyone's staring at the band as they go about tuning and shifting their instruments. The guy next to you has a mohawk that flops over to the side, as if the heat had wilted it. In contrast, the skinhead in front of you is reacting to the heat like a Mexican jumping bean, the muscles of his back tensing and releasing, tensing and releasing.

At the Show

=== pytho.z8 (v8) ===




A small room.  Three men; you recognize only one.

"You, Soteria," says the leader.  "I understand you have an invitation to the Celebration of the Night of the Comet."

Heat floods your face.  How does he know that?  "I have an invitation, but I wasn't sure-- that is, I wasn't planning--"

"You'll go," he says.

The words die half-formed.  An urgent command overrides your personal doubts.

"What am I to do?"

"Speak to the Physician -- he's one of ours, but we've been unable to speak to him of late.  Find out anything he knows about the King's illness.  And protect the King."

"From what?"

The leader smiles a little wryly.  "I wish I could tell you, girl.  This is the Night of the Comet.  It could be anything."

Coffee House


The book on the round, maroon table is looking at you. In this sunny May afternoon, you wanted to read the book and be outside also. So you took it and came to this coffee house. You are wondering what the protagonist will do next.

You glance at the people who are in light colored clothes and look somewhat dizzy from the lightly blowing wind. The umbrella over you provides an ideal dimness. From the speaker near the entrance of the inner café, a woman is singing an ultimately boring French song.

Thus, everything is so suitable to read.

Life sucks. Today has been just another crummy day in another dismal spring which you've spent delivering pizzas. This afternoon has totally been dragging, except for that bit of excitement an hour ago when you broke the soda machine. You thought your boss was going to rip you a new orifice.

Anyway, you've just finished mopping up behind the counter. There's only one more hour left on your shift and you're anxious to get out of here. Go home, watch the tube, blast some tunes, maybe scan the new "Surfers Monthly" magazine... gonna be a nice relaxing evening.

Shyeah, right. That's what YOU think.

Behind the Counter


You are behind the counter at "Mr. Tasty's Pizza Parlor", where you are currently working. Not much of a job, but it keeps you from going broke during the nine months of the year when you can't pull down the bucks as surfing instructor. The rest of the parlor is southwest.

There is something pressing that you think you have to do, but you can't think what it might be.

"You can't miss it," they said. "A white house in a clearing with a small mailbox outside; just open the kitchen window and the entrance to the Great Underground Empire isn't far away."


You found the house and the window all right, and a trapdoor leading down. But as the trapdoor crashed shut behind you, you realized that something was very wrong. Surely the GUE shouldn't look like a large square room with bare walls, and what about those menacing shapes advancing towards you...?

You feel like such a whore. 

First they washed you.  They rubbed your skin with a soft cloth, made you clean and gleaming.  Then they painted you a face, a cute little 'hello, sailor' smirk.  After examining your weight, luster and overall beauty, they determined your price. 

Then they put you out with the others, to wait for passers-by.

Pumpkin Patch


It's a crisp autumn day.  Around you, leaves of gold and orange hang on the trees; Farmer Brown and his wife draw scary faces on the scarecrows to the south.  The road is to the east.  Far off toward the northwest, a small, oddly shaped building sits atop a small hill.

Bedroom
 (on 
the 
bed
)


When the springy energy of muscle long ago gave way to a slothful paunch, you didn't mind. You simply redirected your energies from the libertine idylls of youth to the ruthless game of business, and in that you succeeded admirably. You built Splinecorp from the humble beginnings of your parents' garage into the world's most prominent manufacturer of electronic goods. You invested your whole adult life into the company, and it paid you back handsomely, you sometimes consider as you relax in your sprawling, isolated mansion. But age takes its toll. Even your healthy middle-aged paunch began to dissolve, what remained of your muscles were consumed by sluggish board meetings, and innumerable diseases began to gnaw at you from the inside out. Your increasing frailty has confined you to this bed for the last five years, but your mind, of course, is as sharp as ever and you have no intent of relinquishing your place on the Splinecorp executive board. Fortunately, here in your linen prison, you've provided yourself with the tools to look after yourself: the rack of monitors hanging from ceiling keeps you informed, and of course your faithful Splinecorp-manufactured robots stand by, waiting your command. Hanging on the eastern wall is an ornate tapestry. And standing next to your bed is a comprehensive array of tubes, drips, and associated medical machines, and also a small nightstand. To the south is a doorway to the hallway.


The phone starts ringing.

"Within the castle Shadowgate lies your quest. The dreaded Warlock Lord will use his black magic to raise the Behemoth from the dark depths. The combination of his evil arts and the great titan's power will surely destroy us all! You are the last of the line of kings, the seed of prophecy that was foretold eons ago. Only you can stop the evil one from darkening our world forever! Fare thee well."

Gritting your teeth, you swear by your god's name that you will destroy the Warlock Lord!

Odd, how the light just makes your apartment gloomier. Pre-dawn darkness pools in the corners and around the tops of walls. Your desk lamp glares yellow, but the shadows only draw your eyes and deepen.


Not much of an apartment, no.
 One desk, paper-piled, with a dusty computer shoved to the side.
 Your futon
.
 Second-hand stereo
 sitting on a cardboard crate
.
 A kitchen nook one way and a bathroom nook the other, with a closet to the side.
 A broad mirror tries to make the place seem twice its size; it halfway works.
 One window, whose shade is
 down
, and the front door
 firmly shut
.



Your luggage is piled untidily by the door.
 
A potted 
hyacinth
 sits beneath the window.



You are sprawled on the futon, staring up into that gloom. Your eyes feel gritty. But it's too late -- early -- no time left for sleep, anyway. In a few hours your ride will arrive.


On 
the 
desk
 are
 
your
 
to-do list
 and 
a 
travel book
.

Scooter
 (on

pilot's couch
)
It's been ten years since your stationfall on Space Station Gamma Delta Gamma 777-G 59/59. Your heroics in saving the galaxy from the evil alien pyramid resulted in a big promotion, but your life of dull paperwork has been replaced by a life of dull people work: escorting ambassadors, high-ranking officers of the Stellar Patrol, and government officials; and inspecting starships and space stations. Today you find yourself in a space scooter bound for a space station to perform a spot check, and also deliver some radioactive isotopes for their reactor, using the scooter instead of the teleport in order to surprise everyone. You've been a bit delayed due to a diplomatic crisis on Omicron III and your scooter isn't equipped with communication equipment, so you are arriving unannounced. Hey, rank does have its privileges, and it is meant to be a spot check...

Bathroom


It's midnight. There's blood everywhere because, hot diggety ding-dong damn, you just murdered someone with a plastic spork for trying to destroy the Universe. I mean, congratulations and all, but seriously, that's just...weird, man.The corpse of the man you most royally ensporked for trying to destroy the Universe with only his pinkie finger (he can do that, you know) is lying in front of you on the floor of the derelict, teal, horrible-smelling men's room. There's an entrance to the hallway of the abandoned community center that you're in to the South.




The murder weapon, the spork, is clutched in your trembling fist. Despite how much ass you kicked, you are slightly disturbed. You drop the spork on the floor of the bloody bathroom with a wet click in your disbelief as to how much ass you truly kicked.

=== stinkorswim.z8 (v8) ===






Another morning, another Minnow & Mommy class. It all started off normally enough, with nervous mothers holding up floatie-armed toddlers in the shallow end of the pool. Next came kicking, and bubble-blowing, and screaming... no, the screaming is where things started to go awry. Suddenly there was a mass exodus of minnows and mommies rushing past you to scramble up the pool steps, leaving you face to face with the monster that inspired such panic: a skunk, swimming slowly toward you from the deep end.



=== stonecage.z5 (v5) ===






You and Nok have been chasing the deer since before sunrise. Your legs are scratched and tired. As you approach the woods, you see smoke above the trees, and Nok stops.

It is early, and the grass is wet. The woods are thin enough that you can see the low, yellow sun through the trees.
 Thin trails of smoke curl up into the sky above.




Nok stares at the smoke. He steps slowly back, and gestures for you to enter the forest alone.

=== submarine-sabotage.z3 (v3) ===
You are currently serving aboard the USS Ibis, the first of the US Navy's top-secret Puny class submarines. The Puny class is an attack submarine that packs maximum firepower into a minimum-sized hull. It relies on speed and stealth to surprise the enemy.

The USS Ibis is currently on a training exercise in the North Atlantic, just off the coast of Newfoundland. You were doing some routine maintenance at the aft end of the submarine when the sirens sounded. You thought this might have been a training exercise until you noticed a whitish-coloured gas approaching you from the aft bulkhead. Training and instinct took over. You couldn't get to a gas mask in time, so you dived into the nearby airlock and closed the air-tight hatch behind you.

You are now alone and have no idea what is happening throughout the rest of the sub. You can't leave the airlock through the inner hatch (the one you entered by), or you'll get gassed, and you can't leave through the outer hatch, or you'll drown. What can you do?

You're in the submarine's airlock. It's a small chamber that separates the interior of the submarine from the surrounding ocean. The inner hatch allows you to go up to the main deck of the submarine. The outer hatch allows you to go down to the ocean. The safety system is fully automated with interlocks to ensure that the two hatches can't be open simultaneously.

The Space Under the Window

=== suvehnux.z5 (v5) ===


"Yes, master?"

You rush to your master's side and await his instructions. He is studying a fragile looking scroll and muttering to himself.

He looks up and says, "Ah, there you are. This ..." -- he hands you the scroll -- " ... goes back in the vault. I believe it is still open. And this little beastie ..." -- he hands you a small, empty brass cage -- "... goes back to my private quarters. Thank you, that will be all."

You bow, and head downstairs to the vault. The heavy stone door is wide open, and a golden key juts out of the lock.

Without warning, someone shoves you roughly from behind. The scroll and the brass cage fly out of your hands as you fall to the ground. There is a loud "click", and everything turns black.

PROLOGUE: BREAKTHROUGH


"Due to the circumstances and lack of developments in your project so far, your contract will be terminated, effective immediately."

That's what he said. Some stupid corporate moron sitting in his office, wearing a daft suit and DigiCorp Technologies tie. Years of work, dozens of failed experiments, all the effort, simply to be phased out by a bunch of stupid company directors. As you stand alone in your laboratory, thinking about what might have been, you feel desolate. If only the blasted machinery would work!

Welcome to the world of St Borogrund's School - a world of intrigue, mystery, deceit, and excruciatingly bad dinners. Above a scattering of ugly grey outbuildings, Borogrund's four-storey tower block rises to assault the eye in a bitter and largely futile attempt to get a second glance. 

The end of term looms, and with it the prospect of your school report. Your parents have made it very clear that the report must praise you as a talented and conscientious individual. Being none of the above - but ever loyal to your parents - you make it your quest to seek out the offending report and... amend it. 

Borogrund's isn't just a strange name. It's a strange place. Expect the unexpected. Predict the unpredictable. And for pity's sake, don't go into the staff room unprepared...

Sunlight filters into your form room, where you are obliged to register each morning and afternoon, and falls across the tables as though reluctant to get itself dusty on the linoleum floor. The school's budgetary concerns are manifested in the hard wooden chairs and scratched, worn desks which surround you. A doorway leads east.

Hello!!!! You are William Tell in this: a game about William Tell. In this game you live in Swisserland, which is where the Switzes live. The Switzes love to ski and make cheese and clocks and bank accounts. You, William Tell, are a Swiss in my game about Swisserland. You live in Swisserland City, Swisserland, which is the capital of Swisserland. The year is 1307 AD and a really bad man is PRESIDENT of Swisserland. The PRESIDENT lives in a box on top of a flagpole in the center of Swisserland City which is the capital of Swisserland and everybody who sees the box has to salute the box and say, "HELLO! BOX!!!" and act very reverential because that is where the PRESIDENT lives. This is important because you, William Tell, do not like the PRESIDENT at all and you are going to refuse to salute the box because if you don't you won't get the OPTIMAL ENDING and you won't collect all 10,000 POINTS.

You, William Tell, live in the mountains of Swisserland in a BLUE hut. Today you come down from the mountains with WILLIAM TELL JUNIOR, your SON, who eats paint chips. 

It is a regular day in Swisserland City and you are with your SON. Little do the both of you know what fate has in store for you...!

Street St. in Swisserland City


This is Street St. which is the main and only street in Swisserland City. They only have one street so things don't get confusing. To the north is the center of Swisserland City, which is in the middle of the city. To the south are the north gates. There are merchants here selling lots of things and shouting a lot and waving their arms and jumping up and down, and a lot of people, and a jeep. Life in the big city sure is confusing!!!!!!


You say to your SON, "Hello, SON, stay close to me so you do not die." He stares at you blankly in response.

Familiar as your dream may be, the shapes and the colours that surround you feel as scary as ever. For more than two months the beginning of your nightly nightmares have stayed the same. The old woman drags you up from your bed. Your struggles are in vain against the iron-hard grip of the bony hands as she pushes you out of the window. But instead of falling headlong towards the backyard below you find yourself in an alien world, trying desperately to wake up.

You come to your senses slowly and stagger to your feet, still only half-awake, aware of something...unusual...different... 




A scabby old striped cat with a malignant gaze glares at you from beside the bed. Nothing unusual about that. You've grown accustomed to its face. It kind of makes your day begin. Sad to say.




No, it isn't the cat. It's the ticking. The sound of something ticking... 




Oh no! The cat's ticking.

=== tfmdemo.z8 (v8) ===


Bored with the small selection of CDs you took with you for the long drive to your new life in Las Vegas, you incessantly flip through the five least-staticy stations in search of decent music.  On perhaps your hundredth pass through the static, the evangelists and the country music, a bright red light on the dashboard catches your attention. Your annoyance at this leg of the trip goes up a couple of notches as you identify the little red light as the low fuel indicator.  On a brighter note, you wonder at the good timing since you were getting hungry anyway.

Your anxiety increases a bit as you recall how few and far between the exits along this stretch of Interstate 40 have been. As you begin to wonder if you'll have enough gas to make it to the next exit, relief greets you after a bend in the road; an exit sign! Better still it's an exit sign of green with a smaller blue sign below it indicating fuel and food.  Things are looking up! According to those beautiful signs, you'll be filling the tank and your stomach in the "charming" little town of Dead Rock, Arkansas. You flippantly wonder where some of these town names come from...

Less than a minute later you take your exit and immediately slow down as you leave the highway and come across a "T" intersection. Welcoming some fresh country air, the electric purr of the power windows fills the car as sweet-smelling, slightly humid air fills the car. Your mood lifts immediately.  Now.  Which way to go? With no more signs to offer guidance, you shrug your shoulders and turn left.  A minute or so later of nothing but trees and bushes along the narrow, cracked road forces you to wonder if you made the right choice. Another minute of driving dispels all doubts; you pass a little green sign on the right of the road proclaiming the border into Dead Rock and its 1,247 inhabitants within. Luckily, the service station is one of the first things you see in town making it easy for you to navigate your car towards the gas pumps.

As you approach the station you notice two men in a heated argument. You can't make out what they're saying but the man holding the shotgun seems a lot angrier than the man in the gray jumpsuit who is waving his arms wildly. The perturbed man seems finished with the dialog as he aims the shotgun point-blank at the other man's chest and promptly blasts the defenseless man.  With both barrels. Thrown back several feet, the loser of the argument is dead on the ground in a quickly-expanding pool of his own blood.

The shooter seems to notice your fast-approaching car only now and aims his shotgun at the windshield! Luckily, your reflexes are faster than your brains and you duck as an explosion fills the air followed by the sound of smashing glass.  You feel small prickles of pain at a dozen points on your face but seem to be otherwise alive. Poking your head up to see where you're going, the shooter seems to be concluding his business as he points his shotgun for another chance at you. A look of disappointment tells you he's out of ammo and you're in luck.  The wild look on the greasy man's bearded face contains a shocking mix of anger, frustration and even fear all at once.  He runs off down the street westward as your car comes to a halt in front of the gas pumps. Your fight-or-flight mechanism kicks in and you decide to go after the man that tried to kill you. Without a working shotgun, a fair fight is entirely possible. You jump out of your car and start picking up speed.  Then you stop.  You slowly, painfully turn around and face the car just as you remember leaving the keys in the ignition. As if to accentuate the point that you are deeply in trouble, your car engine chooses that precise moment to sputter out from a lack of fuel.

"Good God," you think to yourself, "what kind of hell hole is this place?"

Mike's Gas & Garage


Seemingly dropped out of the sky as if from a time warp, Mike's Gas & Garage conjures up images of American life in the 1970s and 1980s. From the architecture of the building itself to the old gas pumps, you can't shake the impression that the grimy, run down conditions of Mike's business began the first day he served customers.


Grimy, weather-worn gas pumps stand as silent sentinels against the backdrop of Mike's Gas and Garage. Three car bays all have their glass doors shut with cars occupying each bay. The door to Mike's "office" is open. The road runs east and west.




A dead body lies sprawled on the ground.

~ For Jacob, Oliver, and Martha with love from Dad ~

What a happy day!  You've just finished an exciting visit with your cousins, and now it's time to head home.  It's too far to walk, so you have set out in the world to find a way home.  And, you hope, have some fun along the way.

You can type HELP to get some generic ideas, or HINT to get some ideas at any time.




Pleasant Hill


It's beautiful, sunny, and warm today.  But where you are standing, it's pleasantly cool and shady; enormous green stalks, gently waving in the wind, provide plenty of shade.  Your legs feel warm from the breeze blowing past them, but your bare feet feel pleasantly cool from the soft earth beneath you on a little hill.

It all combines to make you feel quite pleasant.  So pleasant, in fact, that you could just lay down and take a nice nap.  
Or, rather, you would, if it weren't for that huge, and rather grumpy, cricket.


The green stalks are so thick that you can't see far enough to make your way down here.  Good thing you're a fantastic climber; you'll probably have more to see up high.

There is a small path to the north
, but the cricket is standing in the middle of it.

Sure, your job has taken you on all sorts of trips and you've done some weird stuff, I mean you've got to pay the bills right? But tonight's assignment is one you didn't ask for.

Business has been slow lately, and if it hadn't been for Ricky lending you some money a few months ago, you would've had to close the firm. When Ricky showed up at your house the other day, he wasn't exactly asking if you wanted the job - it was more of an order.

And now you're here. You were busy searching in the broom closet, thinking you were alone, when you got a push from behind and fell over. Whoever pushed you also left a message...

You there, you look depressed. How about I try to cheer you up, eh? Would you like to hear a story?

Well, I admit it isn't the cheeriest story, but it's an interesting one. As far as I can tell, it first appeared on an Internet imageboard years ago, but I guarantee you it's a true story. Some of the details are a bit sketchy, though, seeing as how it's been around for so long.

You'd like to hear it? Alright then. Here goes.

If you go into this one tiny, dingy one-story bar in Paris, and the right bartender is behind the counter that night, you might be able to see a very exclusive gallery show of the lost works of one Henri Beauchamp. But, to get in, you have to prove you're a devotee of the artist.

You sit down directly in front of the bartender. He asks you, in clear and perfect English, "What would you like to partake of this glorious night?"

You really expected more.

You expected to crawl through tunnels, to climb down pits, to barely escape with life. Instead you were met with a humdrum walk through a well-illuminated walkway and a canned speech on a half dozen types of stalactites. Next time you'll read the brochure with more attention... You didn't even have a chance to use your new flashlight and compass.

But wait... what's that opening by the exit?




Cave Exit


The excursion has ended, and you are standing by the end of a cave. The path back has been closed for security, and the only way to go is east and out... unless you count a narrow passage to the north.

"You've heard of the Holy Thorn of  Glastonbury?" Professor Wilkens takes another sip of scotch and leans forward in his wing chair. He looks at you expectantly, as if waiting for a show of hands.

A crackling fire fills Professor Wilkens' panelled study with shadows which leap and shift, giving you the unpleasant, but absurd, sensation of furtive things moving just beyond the edges of your vision.

After visiting the engravers to pick up your package, you spend a few hours simply walking the busy streets, soaking in the happy anticipation all around. Then a simple, but magnificent, dinner at Kettners and a gentle stroll home. Time for bed.

Not everyone is complimentary about this courtyard, or the house whose front door you now face. "A gloomy set of rooms" it has been called. But it has been your home these many years; it was the site, a decade past to this very day, of the great visions that changed your life forever. And so here you stay, and here you expect to end your days. The door is north.

Let's be honest. When you took the position as Junior Research Lab Assistant at the Orzel Particle Physics Institute, you weren't expecting anything glamorous. 'A post-doc has to start somewhere,' you told yourself. 'I don't want to teach a bunch of over-privileged undergrads,' you convinced yourself. 'I'd be working for Dr. Roth, who has a pretty good reputation,' you pondered. And finally 'It pays enough to move out of my parent's house,' you realized, with just a tiny amount of glee.

But here you are, seven months later, wondering if you made the right choice. Working for Dr. Roth at the Institute has been some of the most uninspiring work you've ever done. It doesn't help that most of the time, the 'research' tasks he gives you are mostly manual labor. How many times does a person really need to clean the plates for the proportional drift chamber?  And moving heavy spectrometers from lab room to lab room isn't what you had in mind when you were told the Institute was working on problems that required 'heavy lifting'.

So this morning, when you were interrupted and told to pick up the shipment of unstable Cesium-7 isotopes that had erroneously been dropped off by the post office to an address three blocks away, you were disappointed, but not surprised. 'At least you'll get some fresh air,' Dr. Roth told you with a thin veneer of disdain.

After obtaining the package, you're finally on your way back to the lab.

The corner of Jones and Elm


It's mid-morning
, and you are waiting at the intersection of Jones street and Elm street. Traffic is moving 
slowly 
along Jones headed east, and along Elm headed north. The traffic lights are working, and if the pedestrian walk light would ever change, you could walk across Jones and head north back to the lab.


A 5-foot tall metal box sits bolted to the sidewalk nearby, under one of the traffic light posts.

The sidewalks are mostly devoid of pedestrians, although you do notice a woman slowly walking towards Elm street pushing a baby stroller.

You notice a bus slowly trying to get through the intersection.

This must be your 30th time up the stairs today, but fortunately, this is your final trip. All the laundry and cleaning are done, the carpets shampooed and the beds made. All that's left to do is to put away the last load of laundry, make a cocktail, and unwind in a hot bath while the carpets dry. 

However, as you attempt the last of fourteen steps, your foot finds a small toy car inconveniently located as to cause your feet to go west while your head goes east. East, a direction typically no worse than any other direction, unfortunately at this time offers the corner of a banister. Your head's progression is significantly hampered by this obstruction, and as the resulting 'THUMP' resonates throughout the house, your head decides it isn't worth staying awake to investigate further.

You awake somewhat later to find your head no worse for wear but a little foggy, a little confused, and more than a little out of touch....

It is a very strange time and place you find yourself in.

Earth. North America. Early 1998.


From readily available information, and the pronounced fears of a few politicians and information technology leaders, it is obvious to you that things are about to fall apart. Yet the world at large seems blissfully ignorant. Most citizens pay little attention to history and are unfamiliar with how unusually blessed latter-20th-century North Americans have been. 

Peace. Prosperity. We live for entertainment, money, and immediate gratification. 

Most people seem unwilling to believe that the geniuses who've given us all the technology we take for granted could possibly have painted us all into a corner with the Year 2000 century change problem, also known as the "Millennium Bomb" or "Y2K". 

On the other hand, a small but rapidly growing percentage of people - mostly information workers with above-average intelligence - are already predicting the breakdown of banks, stock markets, aviation, public utilities, ... maybe even society itself. 

You are an employee of Biritzcom. It is early 1998. Since this is the demo version, there is a demo fairy flitting about your head, limiting your experimentation to 20 moves for each of Uh-Oh!'s 5 phases. 

(To order the full version, use the ORDERING command.)

Home sweet home for a '60s throwback bachelor like yourself.  Assorted, but unimportant decorations litter the walls and ceiling.

Look out!!! The last thing you remember before the darkness rushed up to claim you is your brother's startled cry. You managed to swerve around the shadowy figure that appeared in the roadway, but lost control as the car jumped the shoulder and plunged headlong into this tree.

Swiveling your battered head you survey the wreckage. You realize that you are alone: your kid brother must have gone off to get some help. As you pry yourself free of the steering wheel's embrace, you can't help but notice the pungent odor of gasoline as it leaks from the ruptured gas tank.

You're on a space station.  This is nothing special in itself, but for some reason, due to your body's genetics, your very presence is causing the station to become unstable.  Stay aboard, and the station will explode. 

You wake up this morning, intending to leave.  Unfortunately, the station's instability has already caused the station layout to change dramatically, and no one on the station even recognizes you...

Wizard's Castle
 game from July/August 1980 issue of

 magazine

Written for Exidy Sorceror by 
Joseph R. Power


Modified for Heath Microsoft BASIC by

Rewritten for

 with help from the folks on

Do you want to play in Classic mode, Normal mode, Statistician mode or Cartographer mode?

Classic mode is as close as possible to the original text, including typos and miscellaneous ugliness. If you're not on a nostalgia trip, normal mode contains less typos and presents a few things (such as the final game summary) in a slightly neater way. Statistician mode is similar to normal mode but uses the status line to display your attributes and equipment instead of printing them out at the start of each turn. Cartographer mode ('m'ap mode) uses the status line to display a map of the current dungeon level.

The other notable difference is in the coordinate systems. In the original game, the 'x' axis was the vertical axis, and the 'y' axis the horizontal. All the new versions use the normally-accepted axes. This change manifests itself only in the displaying of coordinates and in teleporting, so the only thing to bear in mind is that whichever mode you are playing in, you simply need to enter the coordinates when teleporting in the same order as they are printed.

Enter C, N, S or M to select mode:

Jace's Room
 (on 
the

)


Sleek white walls surround your futuristic bedroom, which has been your abode for as long as you can remember. The room is disorganized enough that you nonetheless never know what's hiding in it. Your large bed with its rumpled sheets lies in the southwest corner, opposite a chest of drawers. A writing desk and a stool stand next to you, and a wastebasket lies nearby. A door leads north to a bathroom, and a western door leads to a hall.

The memo was something of a surprise. You'd featured rather heavily in the issue before, and had reasonably suspected that the editor wouldn't want to see hide nor hair of you for a while. However, summoned you have been.

The trouble with these meetings is, you'll never know where it'll lead; whether he'll ask you to write a few hundred words for a box-out, or to spend a day tramping round the London suburbs in search of the homes of C-list celebrities. Maybe it'll just be a straight commission. And if you're really blessed, he'll fall into the usual trap of rattling off so much information in the meeting that you'll only need to transcribe what you can remember. Such are the misdemeanours available to you when your boss is disturbingly well-informed and in love with the sound of his own voice.

Still, you've not much time. Best get your skates on, especially if the receptionist is in one of his difficult moods...

August 24th, 2165.

Utopia Technologies. Industrial giant, economic powerhouse, the world's greatest scientific superpower, and the organisation most responsible for eroding civil liberties and personal freedoms. They're an all-powerful capitalist megacorporation that you despise completely and utterly, yet you're perfectly willing to join their ranks.

The paperwork has been filed, and you're on the way to the California Archipelago in a transport shuttle. There's no turning back now. Tomorrow morning, you'll be a citizen of Utopia, based in the Arcology -- that overcrowded, polluting eyesore of gargantuan proportions. You'll be a mere immigrant worker at the bottom of the corporate ladder, but your stomach still churns at the thought. Your motives for going may be pure, but that doesn't make it easy.

The journey from China has been uneventful, giving you plenty of time to think of your upcoming mission, and the massive responsibility that's been placed on your slender shoulders.




Civilian Transport Shuttle


As opposed to say, a military or executive shuttle, which would have seats to make the trip comfortable and an in-flight holomovie to ease the tedium of a three hour flight from Shanghai. Instead, this is the basic civvie model -- you're densely packed in a titanium can with over fifty other Chinese immigrants. The cabin reeks of sweat but there is nowhere to go, and at this altitude, opening the viewing windows would be the queen of bad ideas.

There is a small mailbox here.


A rubber mat saying 'Welcome to Zork!' lies by the door.

West of House

=== zegro.z8 (v8) ===


You are Zegrothenus, a wizard of some renown, respected for many potions and infamous for a few magical items (but those were experiments in your youth!). It was a dark and stormy night when you learned that your wizard's license would not be automatically renewed this year; the new Council bylaw required all member wizards to invent one artifact every half-decade.


You demanded an explanation. They did not have you specifically in mind, the Council said -- the Council being Faluna, Galadel the Fiery, and Jokan -- but you knew better. Jokan never liked you ("Earth wizards reek," he had informed you three years ago to this day); Galadel considered potions to be strictly amateur; and Faluna, you should have known that half-elves would take break-ups hard. They sent you to your lab, and then those -- curse them! -- "wizards" magically sealed the exits! They set up a pouring potion, as if to mock you, to illustrate how much time you had left. They even said that such measures were required by your penchant for procrastination! The swine!


Moments trickled by as you considered your options. At last, you balled your hands into fists. Very well! You would escape the fastest way possible, by whipping up a potion to startle them all. THAT would show that smirking Council!


You look around your woefully understocked lab, every step reminding you of something else missing. Heaving a deep sigh, you find consolation only in your well-stocked library and extensive glassware collection. You will make a potion, but which one should you make? The question confounds you; all you can think of doing is paging through your formulary until inspiration strikes.

































Zegrothenus

Some days you make the potion, but today the potion makes you -- or breaks you.

Laboratory (By the Table)


You are standing in the center of your laboratory, by the circular chest-level table that looks like the stump of a tree. On further inspection, however, the table reveals that it is comprised of finely-corrugated steel painted and shaped to mimic natural wood. The table sprouts upwards like a mushroom, with an oak vat crouching beneath its eaves and a ceramic black cover, that at one time slid back to allow access to the hollow core. Your glassware spans the surface, and a steel band just below the surface provides hooks for tools. Suspended from the ceiling horizontally in the center of a rusty chain, a low oil lamp provides a bright yellow-gold light.



In addition to all your glassware, the lab table holds:
 
flask one
, 
flask two
, 
flask three
, 
flask four
, 
a 
lead tray
 and 
a 
mortar
.



Eri sits on her haunches, right behind you, as if expecting something.



That accursed reddish potion floats in the air, frothy-white vapors escaping. 
Over three-fourths remains.

The story so far:


Accused of multi-planaterial murder and thrown in the high-security brig of a large federal starship with a life sentence. What a downer. There's probably some fiendishly tricky and elusive way to escape from here if you put your mind to it, you know.



Over to you.

Cell


If you ever get out of here, you really must complain to the prison's standards officers. This place is dirtier and dustier than a dirt factory. If you didn't have better things to do, you'd be in the right mind too give the place a jolly good clean just too spite it. There's a heavily built door to the south.

This is a list of all English Z-code files that are legally available. Therefore, it includes mainly files compiled by Graham Nelson's Inform, but Activision has released some old Infocom games into the public.

ZOMBIES

>LOOK

Dead Storage

This is a storage room. It contains an incredible assemblage of discarded junk. Some of it is so old and mouldering that you can't be sure where one bit of junk stops and the next begins. It's piled to the ceiling on ancient, rotting pallets. A narrow path winds eastward through the junk.


>SEARCH JUNK

You find many worthless items of hardware, old discarded memos and papers, but nothing of any use or value. But wait...
What's that in the corner? A lesser adventurer may have passed this by but not you. It seems to be an old Commodore PET computer and looks like it just might work. Next to the computer are two tapes one with the word "Zombies" scrawled on it in Biro. The other one is labeled "Wrap". Behind the computer on the wall is a power outlet.


>EXAMINE COMPUTER

In computer years this computer is older than Noah's Ark, but in actual years it is a little over two decades old. It consists of a monochrome monitor, tape deck, keyboard (with lots of funny little symbols on the letter keys including hearts, diamonds, spades, clubs, and corners, sides and crosses to allow the user to draw boxes on the screen), on/off switch and power cable; all build into one convenient trapezoidal unit. Performance wise it uses an 8 Bit MOS 6502 processor, has a whopping 4K of memory and the BASIC language on a built in ROM.


>PLUG POWER CABLE INTO POWER OUTLET

Done.


>TURN COMPUTER ON

You switch the computer on.
The screen lights up and the word "Ready." appears in bright green text with a flashing green cursor beneath it.


>PUT ZOMBIES TAPE IN TAPE DECK

(Taking the Zombies Tape first)

Done.


>TYPE LOAD "ZOMBIES" AND PRESS PLAY ON TAPE DECK

Done.
Done.
The word "Loading" appears on the screen and the tape starts spinning.


>WAIT.
The tape is still spinning but not much else is happening.


>WAIT.
The tape is still spinning but not much else is happening.


>WAIT.
The tape is still spinning but not much else is happening.


>WAIT.
At last the tape stops spinning and the word "Ready." appears on the screen.


>TYPE RUN
The screen displays, "Do you want (s)hallow or (d)eep pits?"
