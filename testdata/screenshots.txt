Oh, no - how long have you been asleep? Sure, it was a tough night, but... This is bad. This is very bad.

Bedroom
 (in 
bed
)


This bedroom is extremely spare, with dirty laundry scattered haphazardly all over the floor. 
Cleaner clothing can be found in the dresser. 
A bathroom lies to the south, while a door to the east leads to the living room.



On the end table 
are 
a 
telephone
, 
a 
wallet
 and 
some 
keys
.

Airlock


The alarms just went off, including the flashing lights. But the pandemonium will take a while to get out of your lungs.


The sealed chamber is immersed in darkness, the details lost in the corners where the lights from the fluorescent lamps are unable to spread. The exit door, in front of you, is blocked by three bars that alternately descend to the floor and up to the ceiling. A wide passage opens through a reinforced frame into a corridor to the south.


A voice shrieks from hidden speakers, repeating your name over and over again.

You're still wearing the sand-colored overalls you were in when the earthquake woke you up. It's like a second skin, without pockets or zips, as if it had been heat-sealed on you.



The voice that's all around you gets softer: "CHLOE," it says, "FIRST YOU NEED TO CALM DOWN. DO YOU HEAR ME, CHLOE? DO YOU UNDERSTAND ME? YOU HAVE TO CALM DOWN."

You take a couple of breaths and start to feel the blood in your head subside.

If you're stuck and want a little nudge, try asking for help at intfiction.org. Or write directly to the author at minnocenti(at)kidstudio.it.



"THE SITUATION IS STABLE, CHLOE. NO FURTHER SHOCKS ARE EXPECTED. THE DOOR YOU'RE TRYING TO OPEN IS BOMBPROOF. IT LEADS OUTSIDE AND YOU CAN'T OPEN IT RIGHT NOW."

The only exit from this sealed room is to the south, to the corridor.



"WE ARE APPROXIMATELY TWO KILOMETERS BELOW THE SURFACE. IF THAT DOOR OPENS--WHICH IS CURRENTLY PREVENTED BY OUR SECURITY FAILSAFES--MILLIONS OF TONS OF SEAWATER WOULD RUSH INTO THE FACILITY AND DESTROY EVERYTHING. YOU YOURSELF WOULD BE CRUSHED BY THE PRESSURE IN MOMENTS."

Attack of the Yeti Robot Zombies

This is a try-to-win-on-the-first-attempt game. The point of the game is to try to win on the first attempt. Or, failing that, to win in as few attempts as possible. You are not supposed to use "undo" or "restore" if things are going badly. (Though it is OK to use "save" and then later "restore" if you have to leave the game for a while. And it is OK to save the game as often as you like.)

Car Park


It's an open air carpark overlooking the marina, to the 
north-west
. There's a great looming gate in the way, though. 
South-east
 is the playground, 
North-east
 is the wharf, and 
south
 is the Park Green.




There is a silvery-coloured car 
in
 here.

, type "clues on marina". For help about 
shutting up the pipe player
, type "clues on pipes". For help on 
stopping the dredger

Control Room


This is the control cabin of an immense space ship. Around the room are hundreds of switches and buttons. Dials on almost every surface display the tiniest detail about the ship. At the north end of the room is a flat window which looks out in to the inky blackness of space.

Control Room


This is the control cabin of an immense space ship. Around the room are hundreds of switches and buttons. Dials on almost every surface display the tiniest detail about the ship. At the north end of the room is a flat window which looks out in to the inky blackness of space.

You really want to ask her for a dance, but alas she is from the opposing delegation. If only you could get her alone and pluck up the courage to speak to her.

Ball Room


Though the room is filled with chatter, and couples still dance late into the night, it does not take a trained eye to see that the two parties keep entirely to themselves. Almeri to the left, Tanith to the right, barely so much as looking at each other except when etiquette demands. A breeze blows through the tall windows, the curtains drifting gently to reveal glimpses of the gardens beyond, and on the balcony the band still plays.




The kitchens lie to the north, the gardens east and stairs lead up to the balcony above. The main doors lie to the south, but you cannot leave without your father.




The ambassador's daughter is here, as you had hoped, your heart fluttering as you watch her gracefully dancing with the old general.

You slip into the kitchens unnoticed.




Kitchens


Though you would not normally be in such lowly quarters, none of the servants appear to be here to notice. The remnants of the earlier banquet have been cleared away, leaving only empty tables and a cauldron simmering over the embers of a fire.




The ball room lies back south.




On 
the 
kitchen tables
 
are
 
some 
empty mugs
.




Someone has left a box of tea on a shelf beside the door.

=== AndAHippoNewYear.z8 (v8) ===






'
Twas the night before Christmas when all through the house, the only creature stirring was a hippo the size of a mouse.




This year you're going to stay awake long enough to see Santa Claws. You have set up a temporary nest in the living room closet, and it just needs a few final touches. You intend to venture out to have a snack and look at the tree one more time, and then you will go hide in the closet and wait.

Ancient Observation Window


You are floating, inert, in the centre of a huge chamber. In front of you, just out of reach, is the vast observation window; above you is the floor.




Papers and equipment gently revolve nearby.

This is unabashedly a direct sequel to 
Andromeda Dreaming
 and probably won't make a whole lot of sense on it's own.

Thanks goes to Marco Innocenti for creating the Andromeda Universe and encouraging its expansion, and fellow authors Jim "Truthcraze" Warrenfeltz and Andrew Schultz and Paul Lee.

Pub


You're inside a small and cosy pub. A sign painted over the bar reads:- 'The Nobody Inn'. Certainly, the place seems to be deserted and you can see no exits. The room is lit by a large window that is next to a closed door.


I spy with my little eye...

A bar stool.

Orchestra Pit, in Midair


The earthen sides of this pit look loose and near the consistency of mud. They seem to rush past as the speed of your descent increases.

Flailing helplessly, you fall further into the pit...



Orchestra Pit, in Midair


The light from above dims with each passing moment. A large gnarled root from some hidden root system protrudes from the side of the pit here.

                 "To be able to fill leisure intelligently 
                   is the last product of civilisation." 
                         - Bertrand Russell. 


       
                 "Finally a game worth playing." 
                         - Soolin, 'Games'.










Every day the same old grind, working for a miserable sum that only just allows for a comfortable existence, in a job with very little satisfaction.  It robs all your time, too; time you could fill with the million exciting projects flowing through your head.  So what are you going to do to break out of the rut?  How are you going to escape from the mire of bureaucracy that intrudes into every aspect of life?  Not by buying tickets in the State Lottery every week, that's for sure. No sir, the only way is to be bold, one big step.  So, you decide to steal five hundred million credits, and now is the point when action is required.  Brace yourself and plunge in - run the program on your terminal and then buy the exit visas.  But make sure you get your gun out of hiding first because today's the day.  It's going to be a big one; a very big one.  It almost seems a shame that you have to keep your secrets to yourself.  But you just can't trust anyone, you know.

Plaza


You are standing in a wide open square in the better part of the LonDome.  Bright sunlight shines through the white, translucent skin of the Dome high above.  All around you, people bustle about on unknown errands, mostly avoiding the seedy-looking alley to the south.  A small bookstall lies northeast, and stairs lead down to the subsurface shuttle terminal.  The view, however, is dominated by the imposing building in the east, it's marble facade soaring up to the heights of the Dome.

On-line Help: 
You can move around by entering GO NORTH or NORTH or simply N.  You can use the eight major compass directions plus UP and DOWN.

Just as you can type D instead of GO DOWN, the commands listed below have one-letter shortcuts.  These are shown in brackets.

INVENTORY (I or INV) lists what you are carrying. 
LOOK (L) will describe your location again. 
EXAMINE (X) OBJECT lets you find out more about objects, e.g. 
     EXAMINE THE BEARDED VEGETARIAN 
AGAIN (G) repeats the last instruction. 
WAIT (Z) causes a turn to pass.  Some events are time-driven. 
When speaking to characters use the format NAME, COMMAND as in 
     CALLY, GO NORTH 
When talking to Orac you must ASK (or CONSULT) ORAC ABOUT (or ON) SUBJECT, e.g. 
     ASK ORAC ABOUT ME 
     CONSULT ORAC ON THE LIBERATOR 
To return to the ship from another location, type TELEPORT or BRING ME UP or BEAM ME UP. 
Most obstacles are puzzles that can be solved. 

Meta commands: 
These do not count as moves within the game. 
SCORE - tells you your score. 
QUIT (Q) - to exit the game. 
VERBOSE, BRIEF, SUPERBRIEF - determines how much text is printed on screen. 
VERSION - prints the game version. 
SCRIPT - outputs a transcript of the game to a file. 
SAVE - Saves your current progress so you can play the game later, or try an experimental move. 
RESTORE - Loads a save file. 
HELP - accesses this text.

=== Balances.z5 (v5) ===





[Welcome to a short story called "Balances", one of the example games for the Inform design system. Some people may recognise the setting, but others might like to type "how do spells work" - the game responds to a few such questions.] 

You feel a little confused as to how you got here. Something to do with Helistar!  That's right, and how the world is so far off balance nowadays, after the Great Change.

Ramshackle Hut


Until quite recently, someone lived here, you feel sure. Now the furniture is matchwood and the windows are glassless. Outside, it is a warm, sunny day, and grasslands extend to the low hills on the horizon.

=== BibleRetold.z5 (v5) ===



You came for quietude and serenity - a break from the pressures of being constantly in the public eye. You came for a spiritual retreat: a chance to be with your Father, to think about your future lessons, to meditate on the problems of the world. And what do you get? You get followed - followed by shepherdless sheep, all too eager to be impressed, but not so eager to understand! Your miracles never cease, and neither does the attention you get because of them. 

Yes, the world here is a hostile place at the best of times. Hunger, famine, poverty and uncleanliness are rife. The people are unhappy. The Romans have quashed religion: the priests are corrupt and unholy. 

With the power of God inherently vested in you, only you can save the day. Up-and-coming leader of the people (and a new religion to boot), your followers have... well, followed you! They are weary from the journey and hungry too, but being so numerous, it seems only a miracle could possibly feed them all...

Large Grassy Field


Dock and wild flowers adorn the sweeping hedgerows that surround this large expanse of grass and clover. The bright, open nature of this gleaming meadow makes it a perfect meeting place for Bethsaida's many townspeople. To the northwest, the waters of a large lake lap gently against its shore and in the valley to the east lies a bustling town centre.


A heavy stone tablet falls from the sky, missing you by just a few inches.



A crowd has gathered here today, to watch the Son of God at work performing a miracle.

You can use ABOUT, THANKS and HINT(S) or HELP for additional information about the game. 

HINTS toggle switches hints on and off.




Biscuit, a dear friend of the family has passed on, it is your responsibility to arrange his funeral. Your friend Peter has promised to send a poem by his favourite author, "Stanley Cook", to read over the grave and Joe is insistent that the burial take place in the back garden, by some trees where Biscuit used to lie in the shade on those hot summer days. The sky outside looks suitably grey and overcast, just the right atmosphere for a family funeral.....

=== BlackNWhiteRag.z5 (v5) ===



What a great idea to combine Rag Week with the opening celebrations. . . Removing your blindfold, you find yourself in the Computer Programming Fellow's study, in the new University accommodation.  The buildings have only just been occupied, and the room is equipped with only the barest essentials. You have been locked in the study to raise money for charity (mate!) on the basis that no-one else in your year is reading English and Escapology - the organisers having used the objects already present in the room to leave clues as to how you will get out - without alerting college security!  (It has been rumoured that one of the Economics post-grads is running a flourishing book on your chances. . .)

Welcome to Brand X (Version 0.00)!

You don't need instructions, so you won't get any.

Problems, comments and suggestions to PDK1 or AJM8.

You are standing in a small shop which normally has various goods

displayed for sale. There are areas of the shop

obviously intended for the display of treasure.

There is an exit south, above which hangs

a large sign, which reads:



       ---------------------------------

       !                                !

       !                                !

       !    UNDER PENALTY OF DEATH      !

       !                                !

       ----------------------------------



There is an aqualung with a full tank of oxygen here. It

turns on automatically upon contact with water.

There is a fluffy lace-edged cushion here.

There is a bunch of keys here.

A piece of sausage is curled up here.

There is a small teabag on the floor here.

=== Cacophony.z8 (v8) ===







The sand stretches around you in all directions.




There is a grassy countryside. Rocks are scattered about.




You are in a room. The room has walls and a ceiling.




You blink. It seems as though you've been standing here forever. You feel suddenly stressed; There is something you have to do.

Kitchen


The stench of offal hangs in the air.The walls drip with fresh blood. An ugly table supports plates and a massive assortment of cutlery. This is not an environment that encourages rational thought. Empty doorframes lead north, east, south and west.

Much of this may be familar to you already, but some won't, so here goes...




To move around, use the commands GO NORTH, GO EAST, GO WEST, GO SOUTH, GO UP and GO DOWN, or simply N, E, W, S, U and D.


To view your inventory use the command INVENTORY, or simply I.


To perform an action, use a verb, such as JUMP.


To perform an action with an object, use a verb, the object and the appropriate prepositions.


Examples:  TAKE FISH.  OPEN BOX.  TURN ON TV.  SCREAM AT SHADOWS.  WAVE AT PRINCE OF WALES.  VANDALISE ARTWORK.  READ NECRONOMICON.


Note that you can abbreviate the object names slightly, but the adjectives are used to make distinctions between objects with similar names.


To perform an action involving direct and indirect objects, both objects are required in the appropriate order with a preposition linking them.


Examples:  GIVE BOX TO MAN.  THROW STONE AT PLATE.  EAT SPAGHETTI WITH FORK.  CUT RUG WITH SWORD.  BEHEAD TRAITOR WITH RAZOR-SHARP POSTCARD.  BURN TAPESTRY WITH BLOWTORCH.


Another useful command is UNDO, which will move the game back one turn, like a pre-release time warp device.


The OOPS command has a similar effect, replacing an incorrect word in a previous command with the word following it.


Examples:  PICK UP KINFE.  OOPS KNIFE.  FIRE BAZOKA.  OOPS BAZOOKA.


QUIT allows to to leave the game, SAVE and RESTORE can be used to save and restore games, and RESTART will allow you to start over.




This game includes a "PUT ALL IN (CONTAINER)" command, which you may find useful.




You will have to deal some eccentric situations in this game. Eccentric thoughts may be required.

You stand upon a small stone patio, surrounded by plants. Ripe fruit dip from vines, tempting you with their colours. An ornamental fountain gurgles to your left. Daylight peeks through the heavy layer of greenery above. A dense perfume almost overwhelms you. You can go deeper, to the north. The kitchen is to the south. Stone walls bar all other directions.

Calendar - an Inform 7 abuse

Calendar Room


Despite the introductory text, this is not a work of interactive fiction. It is an abuse of the programming language Inform 7. More specifically, it is a calendar viewer. Try, for example, typing "jan 1970" or "august 2007" or "year 2008". Individual months from January of A.D. 1 to December 9999 can be viewed, but the yearly calendar function is only available for years from 1753 forward.




In case you are wondering what possessed me to create such a monstrosity as this calendar viewer, type "why".

Front Room


You are here, at Sonny Rae Tempest's house, in Louisville, Kentucky, to interview him about his latest Atari VCS game poem "Calm, Mute, Moving." In your pocket is a note, on which you've scribbled some notes about potential question topics. 
Books, clothing, and shoes are scattered about the floor, so crossing the room seems a daunting effort requiring focus and proper foot-placement.

The front door
, which is locked (must ask Sonny Rae about key),
 is on the north wall, and the hallway is to the south.




You 
can 
see 
a 
front door
 and 
a 
bookshelf
 (on 
which 
is 
hundreds of books
)

.

hundreds of books
: 
They're mostly children's books, poetry books, books on how to be a better human, how to take better pictures, draw better figures, draw better conclusions from obtuse scholarly essays, dictionaries, and otherwise books that you would probably have no interest in. Anyway, if Sonny Rae catches you touching his books, he starts twitching. He has a thing about dog-eared pages. It's best to just leave the books alone.

Hopefully this time will go better, and you're thoroughly prepared to demonstrate your talents to whomever will get you that career-making job. 
Your taxi pulls up and you get out, regarding for the first time the offices wherein your future will be decided.

Even science can't explain what the gods usually know. You have moved beyond the synchronistic environment and into a void devoid of null and full of nothing. Your mind will make it real but who controls the mind?

In the desert


You stand in the middle of the desert on a sand deposit so large there is no dune in sight. Only the bright whitish sun hangs as the center piece to a boring portrait; A portrait you are not so sure if you are a part of. The sky glows a solemn blue turning into nothing but a haze as the horizon meets the burnt sand.



In each direction you can see hazy beginnings. To the west, you make out the glow of a city street. To the east you make out a giant cauldron. To the north you are unable to make out much of anything and to the south nothing but a pale white backdrop.


You
 can 
see 
a 
Vulcher
 here.

Cliff


You almost walk yourself right off the edge of the cliff before embracing a rock to hold you back. It's as if this cliff divides what is real and what isn't. From a certain angle you wouldn't even know it is there. You can't make out what is below except for a haziness drenched in mystery.

=== Code_Name_Silver_Steel.z8 (v8) ===






A freelance spy is a great job. It pays well and you get to travel to new and interesting places. Unless you get caught, that part is not so great.

You open the unmarked envelope and unfold the mission briefing enclosed within: 
Infiltrate MegaCorp, gain access to the data centre, download the database.


So here you are, standing in the foyer of MegaCorp, disguised as a repairman.

In this tiny room, a carpet of debris is broken by stone-cut steps leading back down into the darkness from which you came. Though you got here late, it looks like those who came before had a great time.





A bin for 
playable
 games sits here, 
empty.




A bin for 
unplayable
 games sits here, 
empty.




A bin for 
unsorted
 games sits here, 
containing 
twenty
-
seven
 games.




A large lever sticks conspicuously out of one wall, just above the 'playable games' bin. A light below it glows 
red
. The lever is 
down
.



A piece of paper is tacked to one wall, with instructions.

Weazle, the evil wizard has destroyed all that Conan loved. Now, after years of searching, Conan has finally found him. 
Conan is ready for revenge - he will KILL EVERYTHING!





Dungeon


Conan is in a damp dungeon, furnished only with 
an oaken table. The walls consist of yellowish clay. High up on the wall is a single, burning torch. 
A door, leading north, is closed. 



Weazle, the evil wizard spins around as Conan enters the room.

"Ha!", he cries, "here comes stupid Conan whose parents I killed, whose sister I sold to the orks and whose dumbbells I stole! You want revenge! But you will perish!" 

He taps his pointed hat, and a growling wildcat appears out of thin air!

Conan is very strong and full of muscle. 
He has a big sword to kill everything. 
Conan wears a loincloth made of bear skin to protect him from cold and emphasize his well-shaped buttocks. 




The wildcat approaches menacingly, long fangs exposed!

"CUT!"
Studio lights flare up. The director rushes onto the set gesticulating wildly.
"We've got this the wrong way around!" 
He looks at you.
"YOU are the hero, remember? So who's killing who?"
He waves at the wildcat actor who has lit a cigarette.
"You got to finish him off faster!"
He walks offstage, clapping his hands.
"OK, let's do it again!"

"That'll be twenty five cents, Miss," says the driver as he helps you down from the carriage. You hand him a quarter and two nickels.


"Mighty lonely out here this time of year," he continues, slipping the coins into his coat pocket. "Are you sure you won't be wanting me to stick around? I'd hate to see such a fine young lady get herself stranded, especially with that storm blowin' in."


"Thank you, but I'll be fine," you assure him. "My fiance...," you start, then look away, unable to finish the lie.


"Ah, I see," he chuckles. "Well, then I wish you a pleasant afternoon. Just keep your eye on those clouds, ya hear?" Grinning broadly, he jumps up into the driver's box and releases the brake. Then with a flick of the reins he sends the carriage lurching forward, back down the rutted road between the cypress trees.


Finally, you're alone.

Rocky Point


High above the surf, Rocky Point offers a sweeping view of the western sea. From this lofty vantage point, looking south across a narrow strip of sand, you can clearly see the fractured granite cliffs that back the small cove below. To the north, the rugged coastline is dotted with offshore rocks and barren beaches, swept clear of sand by winter storms.


Turning toward the sea, you take a moment to soak up the last few rays of sunlight before the clouds roll in.

You didn't mean to come here. You had packed your bags and donned your best dress, fully intending to uphold your end of the bargain. When the coach arrived and you stepped on board, you were actually looking forward to the journey. A chance to see new things, new people, a new land.


So how did you end up here, 
high on this cliff, 
miles from the train station, at a place you hadn't thought about in years? You shake your head in amazement, the answer still eluding you. 




You find your mind drifting back over old memories of this place.

You walk to the edge and look down.


The cliffs are nearly vertical here, with jumbled piles of boulders at their feet that exactly match the rock up above. With a nervous gulp, you quickly back away from the edge.




A flock of sea gulls rises from the beach, circle the cove once, then head out to sea.

=== Cyclops.z5 (v5) ===





This very short interactive fiction game is only an experiment that is born from the question: "How many  adventurous ideas and puzzles can be drawn from some passages of a literature masterpiece?" 
Which hints, which ideas, to be more precise, can be taken from the Ninth Book of the Odissey, the chapter that narrates the famous adventure of Ulysses and the Cyclops? Let's see. 

Note: much of the text is taken from Robert Fagles' translation of the Odissey, published by Viking Penguin.



But secret I revolved the deep design: 'Twas for our lives my labouring bosom wrought; Each scheme I turn'd, and sharpen'd every thought; This way and that I cast to save my friends, Till one resolve my varying counsel ends.


Homer, Odissey, Book IX



The Land of the Cyclops

An experiment by Francesco Cordella 
Translation from the italian version by Simone "Sauron" Di Conza.

The Cyclops cave 


"But round the grot we gaze; and all we view, in order ranged our admiration drew: the bending shelves with loads of cheeses press'd, the folded flocks each separate from the rest in pens (the larger here, and there the lesser lambs in fence, the new-fallen young here bleating for their dams: the kid distinguish'd from the lambkin lies); the cavern echoes with responsive cries. Capacious chargers all around were laid. Full pails, and vessels of the milking trade. With fresh provisions hence our fleet to store my friends advise me, and to quit the shore. Or drive a flock of sheep and goats away, consult our safety, and put off to sea. In the cavern, warmt by fire, dust is everywhere, even near the great mat of bands, bed of the monster".




Near half a forest on his back he bore, and cast the ponderous burden at the door. It thunder'd as it fell. We trembled then, and sought the deep recesses of the den. New driven before him through the arching rock, came tumbling, heaps on heaps, the unnumber'd flock.




A big rock blocks the entrance of the cave.




In the middle of the cavern there is a beautiful ram, the leader of the flocks.




Your faithful men are here, around you.

The Cyclops is in front of the fire, drinking milk and eating flesh.




A big rock blocks the entrance of the cave.




In the middle of the cavern there is a beautiful ram, the leader of the flocks.

The Cyclops cave 


=== DDIV.z5 (v5) ===





You sneak through the door. So far so good. It was a smart choice to leave Aya behind. She would have just got in the way.

So this is it: The control centre. It is deserted, which is odd. After all the trouble you had to go through to get here... The wild Kroppie Kroppie on Starmus 7, the endless hassle with the four vending machines from hell, your successful reprogramming of the broken doorstop, which helped you vanquish the evil JanitorBot... And now you can just walk into the heart of the evil empire without any resistance? This is strange indeed.

But you are not one to complain when things are finally getting easy. Carefully, you plant the explosives around the room. Emperor Jacklejitt will never again be able to use his Psychotronic Strank-Inversor to enslave the cute yet intelligent Swoobies. The death of the Swoobie princess still brings a tear to your eye. 



Control Centre


Gleaming lights cover the walls. Several big screens are active. Some show the surface of strange, unknown worlds. Some display nothing more than stars. A big chair in the middle of the room looks like a throne and anyone sitting here must look very powerful indeed. It is clear that this is the heart of the evil empire. This is the centre of war and destruction. This is the office of Emperor Jacklejitt III.



Some explosives have been placed in the room.


A large torture table stands next to the throne.

=== Debate.z5 (v5) ===







Your suit has been dry cleaned, your politics file is up to date, and your new affirmative case has been completed and distributed among the team. You're ready for the All-Iowa Finals. This time, you're sure you and your partner finally have what it takes to win it all. Admittedly, things haven't gone so well in the last few competitions... but that was before you had these new arguments. There's only one thing left to do: copy that new negative disad you spent all night on. That should be easy enough.

The Commons is a grand, breathtaking vista of previously unimaginable beauty. At this time of the day, it's usually filled with students waiting for their parents to pick them up. Oddly enough, it's completely empty now. Long stone benches, showing evidence of recent occupation in the form of spilled gatorade, have been placed in a rough L shape in the center of the room. A hallway runs to the west, the east, and the north. To the south is the entrance (and exit) to the school.




On 
the 
stone bench
 is
 
a 
spilled gatorade bottle
.

Reality is so... unreal.

The tangle of observations woven about it, humankind's utter lack of consensus, phases it to fit individual desires. Becoming and unbecoming, back and forth eternally, as it paradoxically coexists with and within infinite variations of itself...

At least, that's what always surfaces in your mind whenever your own perception of reality is altered. Which is to say, ten or fifteen times a day. But it's your job, working to someday entertain others with new observations, new experiences, new realities. And after all, you signed up for the Project (as you well remember, even though it was close to five years ago), so you suppose it's entirely your fault if you don't like it. Which, when you think about it, you realise you do.

Justy's voice reaches out to you from somewhere you can't see. "Okay, this should be it. One final test run to check any overload potential, and this world is done! I'm starting her up."

A loud CLANK, and the Sphere begins spinning, with you inside it.

"Brace yourself!"

Bright lights.

Pain.

From somewhere off in your mind's distance, a telltale splash.

Then, as the resounding thrums fade, a distorted ripple sweeps your vision clear, and all traces of the laboratory vanish from your senses.

All five of them.

Wiped clean, twitching, anxious for new input.

Virtual reality has become reality.

Coral Reef


Tall branches of pale blue coral poke up from clusters of seaweed, glittering in the sunlight that filters down through lapping waves. 


You experience a brief moment of sheer terror as you lose the ability to move your arms and legs, which quickly give way to fins and a flat, rudder-like tail. Freedom -- passionate, exhilarating freedom beyond any known to man -- pervades your spirit. Your vision is foggy, but your other senses appear strengthened.


The reef clears away to what you for some reason perceive as east and west, perfectly calm, still. Almost eerily so. But
 
Strauss
'
 
Voices of Spring
, playing through in your mind, soothes away all tension.


Only Justy's disembodied voice betrays the presence of a virtual reality. "I estimate at max one potential for overload, maybe two. This one isn't all that complex, compared to the lab sim. Cynthesiser's got the analysis sweep running in the background, so you may feel some slight distortion. It's nothing to worry about. Just give us a typical walk -- or should I say, swim? -- through it."

You're standing in a hallway that extends to the north and south, a single painting the only feature adorning its walls. The door to the toilet is west.

You really need to pee!

Your are standing at the front of your house that's to the south in your normal and very beautiful neighborhood.  So beautiful in fact that it even got your lazy bum to start planting flowers at your front home , just to keep up with your neighbors.  It was peak peace and joy, this place. Except for that thing.




A tall object that you think is a mailbox stands at the front of your lawn.

(
Piller box
)

You went down to the base of mailbox and grabbed it at both sides. You slowly started to lift with your knees(good on you). It almost looked like you weren't able to do it. But a mircale came and you gradually lifted the blasted thing. 
 Hooray!!
 You thought but don't cheer to fast. Wait you decided to jump up and down with the mailbox in celebration.


And yup you underestimated the weight because you have been crushed by the thing.

Well you had a good run.

=== DuckMe.z3 (v3) ===


You are awakened by a violent shaking sensation. It feels like an earthquake. The bed is moving from side to side so much that you are thrown from it onto the floor. After a while the earthquake subsides and you stand up. Even allowing for being thrown out of bed, you don't feel very well, but you're steady enough to move about a bit. Oddly, you don't recognise this room or remember why you are here. Even your own name eludes you, which is a bit worrying.




Fowl Play Adventure 1 - "Duck! Me?"

An absurd, nonsensical, old-fashioned 1980's style text adventure.

Bedroom


A sparsely furnished bedroom, or more accurately, a room with a bed in it. It looks like someone has just put a bed in a spare office, possibly for power naps.



You can 
also 
see 
a 
beside table
 (on which 
is 
a 
letter
)
 (under which is 
a 
badge
)
 and 
an
 
electric torch
 here.



On 
the 
bed
 you can 
also 
see 
a 
pillow
.

You appear to be a cuddly toy duck.

You are hungry and weak.

You are thirsty and dehydrated.

You have a nasty tear in the side of your head and some of the stuffing is poking out.

Because of your condition, you may not be able to complete some actions.

This is a bit of a lark. Do not take it seriously.

After playing Greg Hassett's 1978 adventure game King Tut's Tomb and making a map in Trizbort, I cut out half the rooms and used the "generate source" feature. I then used random generators to clip excerpts from the Internet for object descriptions and room description.

The poetry that comes from using objects is a mix of random word generators and hand-made lines by myself, but it may be difficult to tell the difference.

The only way to end is to QUIT.

When I was shot by elephants for the third time, I finally believed... and barely survived to bear witness.

Hundred Acre Wood


We moved there shortly after Chris got evicted from his tiny apartment in the City. That new place was not only filled with a despicable amount of trees, but also unbearably hot and humid.
 Many untold dangers lurked among the lush vegetation, as I was soon to find out.

=== Enemies.z8 (v8) ===


It will forever remain one of life's mysteries: why should a simple man like yourself get on the wrong side of anybody? 

You are, after all, just a typical accountant. A little sideline romance with the secretary (what's she called -- Joanna) is a pleasant diversion from the tedium of your nine hour working day. Even your name, Charles Johnson, is unremarkable.

Unfortunately, in today's world, security is nothing more than an illusion. Predators, sometimes even our most trusted friends, make plans for our downfall. Unseen snipers close in, ready to pull the trigger when we least expect it.

Perhaps it's just human nature -- everybody has....

Princess Street


The weather has rapidly deteriorated, raindrops bouncing off the slanted marquee onto the pavement. Darkness comes early in the winter months, but fortunately the street lamps keep this area of the city well illuminated. The prospect of the warm lobby of the eight-screen cinema to the west becomes more attractive with each passing second.


You take another glance at your watch: twenty minutes to seven. Glancing up and down the street, the only pedestrian you see is a down and out disappearing into an alleyway. 
Where is she?


You had arranged to meet Joanna at half past to see a movie, and possibly a romantic dinner afterwards. It came as a relief when she accepted your invitation, with all the attentions that slimy boss of yours, Keith, has been giving her lately. Now you're beginning to think your short lived luck has run out already.

Charles Johnson, 
accountant.



An orange minibus, part of the late night student service, drives along the street without stopping. You catch sight of the large puddle by the kerb just in time to dodge out of the way of mini-cascade which follows the vehicle's speedy passage through it. Before you can shout any profanities at the driver, the bus has become nothing more than a trail of lights in the distance.

Princess Street


The weather has rapidly deteriorated, raindrops bouncing off the slanted marquee onto the pavement. Darkness comes early in the winter months, but fortunately the street lamps keep this area of the city well illuminated. The prospect of the warm lobby of the eight-screen cinema to the west becomes more attractive with each passing second.


A young couple make their way into the cinema, disappearing into the lobby.

=== FFF.z5 (v5) ===



It's your first day on the job at the Speedy Express delivery company, and there's one last batch of cargo to be delivered before you can call it a day. You start to wonder whether you followed the directions correctly when the road dead-ends at a large body of water. Then you remember the shift supervisor's parting words as you pulled out of the warehouse this morning: "By the way, you do know how to row, don't you?"

South Shore


You're at the southern shore of a wide river which runs east to west as far as you can see. A stretch of fine sand here makes for a scenic, if narrow, beach. A wooden dock extends out several feet from the beach into the water. Across the river, a hundred yards or so to the north, you can just make out the far shore. To the south is the road you drove in on, your delivery van parked off on the shoulder.




Tied to one post of the dock is a rowboat.



You
 can 
also 
see 
a 
fox
, 
a 
duck
 and 
a 
sack of grain
 here.

Village Square


This is the centre of a small village made of concrete. The square extends to the east where you can make out some buildings. Surprisingly, someone seems to have planted an oak tree here.

=== Fork.z5 (v5) ===





Is it an innocent affection? An irrational obsession? An outright fetish? Or just a handy reference point for the term "disposable income"? You're certainly not generally given to nostalgia. Whatever the reason, you still enjoy playing old video games. Real ones, from back when games were games and movies were movies, and they never seemed to get themselves confused.

It's not as if you need a reason. Taking genuine pleasure in something automatically justifies it (and, you're convinced, also justifies having caught a train to this weird city). You don't have to think twice about the reason for which you attend these conventions. There are, put simply, a lot of games inside.

So what if all your spending money went to the train ticket? Salivating never hurt anyone.

Baer Boulevard


People walk up and down this ribbon of old brick buildings, alternately holding hands and giving each other the finger. Since you're on vacation, you try to remain patient long enough to take in the sights; but since these are mostly made up of the immense hotel to the south, inside which is the convention, you find this difficult. Alleys open to the southeast and southwest, and a nearby manhole gapes from within caution signs. Amazingly, given their various apparent conditions, the passersby seem to be heeding this advice (enough to avoid actually falling in, anyway).


(Enter ABOUT for more information, or HINTS as a last resort.)

Conservatory


You are in a conservatory which is currently fulfilling the function of a junk store for anything you haven't got round to throwing out yet: a pile pf Betamax videos, decrepit old computer monitors and a broken lawn mower are piled in the centre of the room. You could go north to your back garden or south to your living room.




Muttley is here. He 
barks
 at you and puts on his 
"I'm a cute doggy"
 look.

 You live in a Home. Not your average, middle of the street home, but a home for the Confused. I.e. an asylum. 
 You were put there after being found guilty of instigating the great Gerbil Riot of 1967. A heinous crime. 

 You have a hobby - escaping. To date you have been unsuccessful but you decide to give it one last try.

'Treatment' Room


 The 'Treatment' room. All the inmates associate this place with pain and suffering. Threatening machinery glares at you from around the walls. 
 One cupboard in particular demands your attention and a body slumped on the floor brings back uneasy memories. 
 The open doorway is South.




I await your advice.

=== GreatXavio.z5 (v5) ===




You'd been soundly sleeping, comfortably, soundly sleeping, when Dr. Todd called. He's your thesis adviser, and as such, he holds unconscionable power over you, which he uses for, well, whatever he likes, really. "Hagerston," he'd said. (You do have a first name, but no, nobody ever uses it.) "You do think it's important we apply our brains in a logical way, and not yield to mumbo-jumbo and mystification?" You acknowledged this was true. With Dr. Todd, a bad idea. The result was you agreed to meet him in front of the Hotel Farfalla at 3 AM. There was some reason, perfectly logical according to Dr. Todd, for this request, but you can't for the life of you now remember what it was.

Front of the Hotel Farfalla


The Farfalla is one of the grand old San Francisco hotels. Not the sort of place you'd go on your own. But then you're not here because you wanted to be. It's eight stories of still pretty much gleaming white marble, and no doubt a room costs as much a night as your apartment does for the month.
 It was founded in 1898 by Luigi Fornoni and this is the second building to bear the name. The first was destroyed in 1906 and Signor Fornoni rebuilt in an even grander style. You'd got that far on the brass plaque when Dr. Todd showed up. It was more than you really wanted to know.




"Well, Hagerston, I'm glad to see you're here in order to accomplish our mission."

You're dressed like you were woken up in the middle of the night. That may be because you WERE woken up in the middle of the night. As Dr. Todd would no doubt say, there's a logical explanation for everything.

Dr. Rex Todd and his graduate student Hagerston are the heroes (or something) of a couple of other things I've written. This was their (and my) first foray into interactive fiction. It was entered in the 2004 IF Competition, where it placed 11th. This is the third version of the game, much improved by the post-competition reviews.

If you've never played any form of interactive fiction, type INSTRUCTIONS at the bottom for a brief introduction.

To find out who tried to save me from myself, type CREDITS.

There are a few special verbs, which should be fairly clear in context. Telling you what they were at this point, though, would constitute a spoiler.

There are at least two ways to solve every puzzle. Some objects have more than one use. Some have no use at all.

Since everybody does conversation in a different way, here's a quick suggestion. The most useful conversational form is:

ASK x ABOUT y

In particular, you may want to start off by typing this (this isn't much of a spoiler):

ASK DR. TODD ABOUT THE MISSION

There are hints available in the game, though you need to figure out how to find them yourself; WALKTHROUGH is available for one possible bare-bones path through the game. ALTERNATE is an alternate walkthrough with different solutions to each problem. It was the original walkthrough at the time of the competition, now slightly tweaked.

If you just can't get enough of things reesewarnerish, there's more at www.reesewarner.com/writing. Also you can email me at reese@reesewarner.com. I'd love to hear any comments you have.

You're still not sure why you agreed to this adventure, but if you tried to leave now, Dr. Todd would no doubt tell you it was illogical to begin something and not finish it.

Lair


You are wedged comfortably into your lair, relaxing in the cold comfort of a stone crevice, the walls worn smooth by years of occupation. Here, the darkness is complete, like Mother's comforting, opaque fur. No luminous fungi or glowing worms venture here with their harsh, painful light.


Also your eyes are closed.

=== Gumshoe.z5 (v5) ===


Reluctantly, you crack a gluey eyelid to the world. Your head surges with pain, and you quickly shut it again.

The whiskey gods were not kind to you last night.

You search your memory for the reason behind this latest drinking binge. This proves difficult, because there have been many such nights since you were removed from your job as detective on the force. Now it comes back to you. The rent being past due on your new office. Marge badgering you about her paycheck. Your empty bank account. Your complete lack of clients. The money you owe Jimmy Voigt. You wince, not even wanting to think about Jimmy Voigt.

Last night, you took your troubles to ole Johnny Walker and he listened good. One drink led to another, and that naturally led to the next. Now you find yourself awakening on a cold, tiled floor.

You look like someone who spent the night sleeping in their clothes on a cold, hard floor. Not surprising, really, since that's exactly what you did.

        PLOT INTRODUCTION


        A long time ago, when mystics, warriors and villagers 
        with smelly socks roamed the land, things were great. 
        You could slay dragons, beat up no-good thieves, and 
        even go on adventures with your drinking buddies. To 
        add to it all, there was a princess to chase after and 
        a king to swear allegiance to. All in all, life was 
        grand. 

        Until one day, that is...An evil dragon has taken refuge 
        in a nearby cave. As the King's chief dragon hunter, it is 
        up to you to slay the dragon dead. Good luck!

Guild


You are standing in a large guild room. A large crescent flag with a star emblazoned on it drapes down from the ceiling. A few tables and chairs are here, as well as a large fireplace. The fire is currently burning, illuminating the room in a soft glow. You notice some logs on the fire, burning quietly.

Type 'HELP' for a list of commands used in HLA Adventure.

You notice a small bulletin board here.

HLA Adventure is a text adventure. You play by entering in commands as follows (for example):


GET SWORD (or TAKE SWORD)
DROP SWORD (or PUT SWORD)
EXAMINE SWORD (or EXA SWORD)
WIELD SWORD
UNWIELD SWORD
WEAR ARMOR (or DON ARMOR)
REMOVE ARMOR (or DOFF ARMOR)
EAT FOOD
USE ROPE
PLAY FLUTE


(Press any key...)

KILL PALADIN (or SLAY PALADIN)
GO NORTH (or N)
INVENTORY (or INV or I)
LOOK
SCORE (or ?)
ENTER PORTAL
HELP
CREDITS
SAVE (or STORE)
QUIT


Unfortunately, you can sometimes confuse the parser by accidentally entering in verbs or nouns it does not recognize. Some additional verbs you might try include:


TALK (or 'TALK TO') and 'SAY'.

=== HallowEve.z8 (v8) ===






Today is October 31st, 1987. Your friends have invited you to join them for a night of camping and partying. The campsite is around a two hour drive from where you live now. You aren't sure who the property belongs to, but it's not far from where Fred Murks
'
 grandmother lived. You, Fred, and another friend of yours named Steve Dirks had made the site as kids before she died a couple of years later from pneumonia. You haven't been back since then. It was at least a cool place to go when you were too young to be smoking cigarettes because no one ever bothered you out there.




Your friends are bringing the camping equipment, food, and beer. It should be a fun night. Supposedly some girls were going to be showing up as well, but we'll see about that.




You come around one last tight curve and see Fred's car parked on the side of the road. It's probably safe to assume that they have already gathered their stuff and went to set up camp. You park nearby, and then feel the chilly air of the Fall afternoon as you step out of your car and lock the door...

Roadside


You are standing by the road that brought you here. A large mountain looms on the other side of it. You can barely make out the faint white noise of rushing water coming far from the southeast. To the west of you is a clearing in the briers which provides an entrance to the woods.

Ah, the hat incident. You were peacefully doing quadratic equations and pythagoras (yes, I know they're not linked) when you realised you weren't wearing you top hat. You can't think of anything that could have happened other than the lousy Lord Sir Syd Mr Crab stealing it.

Living Room


Your cosy living room is inhabited by a plump brown sofa and your desk in the corner. To the east is that crab. Or at least you hope so. He better not be scuttling around your house.

=== Help.z8 (v8) ===




Is this a (N)ew or (R)estored game? 



Amid the mangled virtual-ware littering this sector, your "Best Help" trophy stands defiantly. It has survived the crash.




In a fit of aftershock, a large console ejects from the other ship. It hurtles toward your trophy.





When Help Collides

Crash Site
Like a deer in headlights, you stare in horror.



Twisting slightly from its original course, the console slams into you.




Stunned twice in a matter of milliseconds--that's just not right.




Imitating the ejecting console, the ship that caused this accident seizes
 its
 better-late-than-never opportunity. You recover just in time to see the reference plate of the H. M. S. Co-Dependence disappear into cyberspace.






Why was a Self-Help in this sector?

Since their first appearance on the scene, the Self-Helps have been "passive-aggressive" (their term, your opinion). They irritated, but they did so from within their own little self-actualized worlds. They were content in knowing that you were aware of them, that you were visualizing them shaking their heads at your lack of personal integration and weak psycho-social interaction. If you wanted your transference patterns, a cognitive analysis or just a good old-fashioned kick in the pants, 
you 
had to go to
 them.


Now one of 
them 
inflicts a hit-and-run against an innocent, gaming Help Module Ship. Was this an accident or the ushering in of a new era, one of active consciousness insinuation?

"NNNN nnnn NNNN nnnn..."

The oscillating buzz emanates from your ship through the hatch. The sound barely reaches way out here.

Enough contemplation. A player needs assistance immediately.

[Press SPACE to continue]






Ever since that night eight years ago, memories have haunted your sleep: katana flashing through the air, your mother's executioner wiping it clean, remarks he made to your father as you tasted your first mouthful of seawater.

"A detective with the ACPD, and to think you had my complete trust. We all make mistakes, Mister Flint. Yours were to have a wife and daughter. They would have lived long, happy lives had you accepted my payoff and walked away."




Drowning
 (in 
the 
Atlantic 
ocean
)


You can't swim. In thirteen years, you never learned how.

Not that it would make any difference. No teenage schoolgirl could hold her own against strong Atlantic currents. The swirling waters drag sediments of sand up from the seabed. Moonlight filters through the planks of a wooden jetty, one of many around Maiden's Wharf.

Your school blazer weighs heavily on your back, porous nylon absorbing seawater like a sponge. Leather boots, fastened and waterlogged, drag you deeper.

Drowning
 (in 
the 
Atlantic 
ocean
)


You can't swim. In thirteen years, you never learned how.

Not that it would make any difference. No teenage schoolgirl could hold her own against strong Atlantic currents. The swirling waters drag sediments of sand up from the seabed. Moonlight filters through the planks of a wooden jetty, one of many around Maiden's Wharf.

=== Hide_a_pachyderm%21.z5 (v5) ===






Now you are gonna be in trouble. You are well aware of the fact that you are not allowed to keep pets in your apartment, but you could not leave your dear pet elephant behind when you moved in. He is your friend. You did your best to keep him hidden from the neighbors and your landlord Julius Vanderbuilt, an aged man with a stern look. But someone must have noticed the trumpeting earlier today, and now some person is knocking at your door, so you need to react.


Type ABOUT for information about the game, HINT if you happen to need advice.

tenement


Your crappy apartment, seen in its entirety. It is fully furnitured, and there is not much else to say about it. The exit door is in the west
, and somebody is continuously knocking
.




Among other pieces of furniture is a fridge.




Your pet elephant stands in the middle of the room.




A hi-fi system is placed in one corner of the tenement.

=== HouseOfDreamOfMoon.z8 (v8) ===







Your very first night is over in your new house.  It still seems surreal that you are now the proud owner of this place.  It doesn't quite feel like home yet since you haven't been able to get your furniture.  However, you can't get the rental truck until tomorrow.  Maybe today would be a good idea to explore those woods behind your house.  It'll be a good way to kill time until you can get properly moved in tomorrow.

Master Bedroom
 (on 
the 
mattress
)


All that's unpacked in the room is your mattress
 with a sheet thrown over the top of it
.  Your dresser is still in storage.  Windows look out to the north and west, and the closet lies to the south.  The hallway is to the east.

"House of Dream of Moon" is the third IF Whispers game, written consecutively by ten people who only got to see the part before theirs.  It follows in the glorious footsteps of "The Corn Identity" and "An Escape to Remember", but shares nothing but the format and a few authors with those games.  Tom Blawgus was the moderator of this Whispers incarnation, and wrote the first section.  To see who wrote any given section, type "author" while playing that section.

=== I-0.z5 (v5) ===




You're Tracy Valencia, first-year student at the reasonably prestigious University of Dorado. Sure, it's not Berkeley -- hell, it isn't even Stanford -- but it's light-years better than Dorado State, where your older brother Trevor goes. Dorado State's just a party school. Trevor makes a point of rubbing this in every time he calls.

He'll be able to rub it in in person soon enough: it's Thanksgiving Day, and you're driving home. Daddy was perfectly willing to buy you a plane ticket, but like you told him on the phone, there are much better things to spend the money on. Birthday presents, for instance -- you turn eighteen tomorrow. Besides, it's only a four-hour drive.

Two and a half hours into said drive, the car starts making a noise no piece of machinery should ever make. It's the sort of sound a rhesus monkey might make being forced down a garbage disposal. Now, Dorado is nothing but scorching desert from the time you cross the coastal mountains until you reach the river; true, it's the scorching desert in which you grew up, but sentimentality aside, it's not exactly the best place in the world to find yourself stranded. But you've got to do something about this noise, if only because it's drowning out the stereo. So you pull over. You're just about to switch off the ignition when the car goes dead of its own accord. You try to start it up again, but absolutely nothing happens.

Guess what, Tracy? You're stuck on the loneliest stretch of Interstate Zero miles away from the last sign of civilization. It's twenty minutes to noon and the temperature's well over a hundred and twenty. You already miss the air conditioning. It's beginning to look like Ed and Sandy Valencia's only daughter might not make it for Thanksgiving dinner...

In your car


You're sitting in your lifeless car on a desolate roadside, a good half-hour drive away from the last gas station you passed.
 It's at least a hundred and twenty degrees outside -- not uncommon in the Doradan desert, even in November -- and the heat is quickly becoming unbearable.
 The key is in the ignition, if you care.

Well, Tracy, you're five-foot-seven, a hundred and seventeen pounds, with brown eyes, long dark hair and golden-bronze skin. More to the point, you've got the kind of face people write poems about, a smile that makes grown men weep, and the kind of body every girl would love to have and every guy would love to, y'know, HAVE.

 lead through the snow back into the distance. Everywhere else is blank and undefined; the

 and the

 are one solid, flat plane ahead of you.




Something silver is sticking out of the snow.

IF Whispers 5
 is a collaborative "Chinese Whispers" / "Telephone" style work of interactive fiction. Each section besides the first was written by an author who saw only the immediately preceding part. However, authorship continued around in a cycle, giving each person a chance to write a second time, using their prior knowledge of what they and the preceding author wrote to hopefully make the final product more cohesive as a whole.




To see the author and subtitle of the current section, type "author". You can find the website for this project at http://novelinteraction.wordpress.com/ if you'd like to view the source code or find more information about the game.

Coffee House


All the closed places provide shelter for the people from the rain. In days like this, coffee houses are more crowded than ordinary days. People talk to each other and there is a humming sound in the place. The music is some old school rock'n roll.

You are tired and wet. While waiting for your tea to come, you are trying to have a rest. You are also so busy examining the people in the café that you did not realize somebody approached... It's a boy. He said something.

What a mess! The hurricane did a real number on the old
 
family home
, and to think it would happen the week that your dad is moving out!




You notice some movement from an upstairs window. A woman that looks somewhat familiar leans out and throws out a
 
paper airplane
 
that floats down and lands by you.




"There you go, CJ! See you at dinner!" she shouts, then slams the window shut.




"Huh. Who the heck was that?" you say to yourself.




[Tutorial: You can LOOK to check out your surroundings. You can type TUTORIAL OFF to turn off this brief tutorial at any time.]

=== Inevita.z5 (v5) ===






         "They followed him to the end. A million souls,

      blinded by a madman, destroyed in the blink of an eye.

             Fools - couldn't they see the outcome was

                        inevitable?"




      
   
      



"Move!" you shout over the storm, shoving the Ambassador into the shuttle then slamming the outer door closed, giving the vessel a solid rap when all is secure. Backing up a few steps, you immediately lose the craft in the driving rain, with only the whine of the engines indicating which way not to go.


You turn away, struggling against rising winds as you retrace your steps to your fighter and crawl inside, cringing when the shuttle's premature lift-off sends a barrage of stones against your hull. Great, just what you needed - more dents.


Skipping preflight, you quickly check your straps, grab the stick and flip the switch to fire the engines.


Nothing happens.

Rocky Terrace
 (in 
the 
ALT/EF-32
)


High winds send sheets of rain against the canopy, turning the outside world into shades of misty gray and deep black shadows. 
Inside, lights blink all across on your console - never a good sign.


The engine switch is on. 


You scowl, fingers tightening around the pouch.

Thirty-eight going on forty-five, or so the rumor goes. Days like this make it seem more like fifty. 
"
Perfect
," you grumble, eyeing 
the flashing lights and 
the enveloping storm with 
equal 
disgust.



While touring old massacre sites is never high on your priority list - particularly this site - the Domin Ambassador had given you his personal assurance his guard would see to everything, that you wouldn't even have to leave your fighter. "What could possibly go wrong in an abandoned city on an abandoned planet, Commander Tanur?" he had laughed, trotting up the stone steps with a dozen men in tow. Two hours later, when the winds surpassed eighty knots, he had his answer.

Credits and Notes


Many thanks to Ola Sverre Bauge, Larry Kwong, and David Glasser for testing. Thanks also to Ben Hines, Mary Kuhner, and Marnie Parker for pointing out problems in the first release. 

With apologies and thanks to Graham Nelson the developer of Inform for his kind, if silent, permission to use bits of the Inform Manual. Also to Andrew Plotkin whose genie I have stolen and whose idea I have trivialized. And to all those others who have been researched. 

Special mention should be made of Douglas R. Hofstadter and his delightful book "Gödel, Escher, Bach" for many of the ideas that underlie this game. 


[Any character to continue.] 


Filthy, battered, itching fiercely from an unrecognized encounter with poisonous plants, and nearly exhausted, you have been slogging these bleak and forbidding lands for weeks. You drained your account at the Absconders and Defaulters National Bank to mount this expedition, and now the gin is running out. You don't even want to think about your liver. It may not be worthy of exhibit in the British Museum, but the pathology department at the Hot Cross Hospital will certainly be interested. 

You feel like weeping; you might as well have stayed by the slit in the stream bed and waited for plate tectonics to widen it. You are in front of that all too familiar white house again!



West of House


You are standing in an open field west of a white house.  The front door is not boarded up; there is no need. To the right of the door is a small window, apparently a recent remodel, which is slightly ajar. 

A rugged path to the west winds into the badlands.




The massive steel front door, which would do credit to a bank vault, is tightly closed.




There is a small mailbox here, of course.

Pro
logue  -  Century Park



New Year's Eve, 1999, a quarter to midnight and where else to be but Century Park! Fireworks cascade across the sky, your stomach rumbles uneasily, music and lasers howl across the parkland... Not exactly your ideal party (especially as that rather attractive stranger in black has slipped back into the crowds) - but cheer up, you won't live to see the next.

Century Park


At one side of the great Park, on a gravel path which runs west to northeast beside poplar trees. Crowds of celebrants are enjoying themselves to the north, having abandoned the canvas marquee east.

Pro
logue  -  Century Park



New Year's Eve, 1999, a quarter to midnight and where else to be but Century Park! Fireworks cascade across the sky, your stomach rumbles uneasily, music and lasers howl across the parkland... Not exactly your ideal party (especially as that rather attractive stranger in black has slipped back into the crowds) - but cheer up, you won't live to see the next.

Century Park


At one side of the great Park, on a gravel path which runs west to northeast beside poplar trees. Crowds of celebrants are enjoying themselves to the north, having abandoned the canvas marquee east.

Your micro enterprise, Kentish Plover, has been a success in starting up. You've managed to convince people to start playing interactive fiction in the local area. Now, if you're going to make the business a success, you should probably spread the word further afield.

Cramped room


This room is so cramped it feels more like a cupboard than anything else - and with a low ceiling, too.

(This game is being run according to rules mostly based on a simplified role-playing game called Woodpulp & Wyverns, or W&W. The protagonist is a rogue, whose main ability is to wander down into dangerous places and get killed. We are in search of both riches and experience, but we're more likely to get the latter than the former. The SCORE command shows the current experience total and what's left to get for the next level. An INVENTORY (or I) lists the items carried.

W&W play differs from conventional interactive fiction in that there is a great deal of randomised behaviour. Notations like 4d6+2 express the (virtual) dice rolls to be made: this one would involve rolling 4 six-sided dice, then adding 2 to the result. Combat is an especially unpredictable business, but note that one can often run away from a fight which is going badly.

The SAVE and UNDO commands have been withdrawn. Typing "EXITS" will list all the possible ways out of a room. Important information about your armour and weapons can be accessed by taking inventory. Before a weapon that you're carrying will have an effect on combat, you must WIELD it.

Lastly, this game was made possible through the wonderful generosity of Graham Nelson, who not only wrote the Inform 7 language which made it possible for a humble nonprogrammer like myself to do something like this, but also wrote The Reliques of Tolti-Aph in such a way that most of the other work had already been done. Additional thanks go to K_M, Emily Short, Andrew Plotkin, Jason Orendo, and Eric Eve, who responded to my questioning on the forum, and thereby pretty much did all difficult parts of this project.)

=== Leopold.z5 (v5) ===
It was a bright sunny day when the catastrophe occurred. Leopold, whistling softly to himself as he made his way back to Old Sam's cottage, carrying a quart of whisky which the old codger argued was necessary for the curing of his flu, heard his mentor sneeze mightily. It rattled the door as he stretched his arm to open it, vibrating it so much that it opened of its own accord.

Leopold poked his head around the door trying to judge the safety of the situation. It seemed to be okay. "Here," he said, striding into the rather sparse room, "I've got your medicine. Ol' Grumpy Boggert said you owe him five silver pieces."

"Bah!" said Old Sam, sucking heartily on his pipe and blowing the acrid smoke upwards where it scorched the ceiling. "Boo've baken bong enub!" he said to the Minstrel, arms reaching eagerly for the smallish barrel.

"Sorry," said Leopold, raising his eyebrows upwards to a brief encounter with his hairline. It was there and then that it happened.

"Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaachoooooooooooo!" sneezed Old Sam.

Leopold, falling over from the shock, was unprepared for the aftermath.

"By Lude!" screamed the old man. "I'be broken by Lude!"

Looking over, Leopold could see that his master had fallen out of his chair and onto the precious Lute of Lyranth. He cringed. It was priceless. And he rather hoped it was going to be his some day. He sighed. He knew, of course, what this meant.

"Boo'll hab do bix id!" said Old Sam. "I'b bar doo ill. Bed de nexd coach do High Biddledon. Bind someone dere. Bell? Move id busder!"

Leopold sighed again. He picked up the ruined instrument, and walked off. Hours later, after a rather bumpy coach-ride had done a little extra damage to the Lute, he found himself near to the town...

Outside the Inn


A soft cool breeze introduced itself to the Minstrel with an abundance of energy that not only thrilled his undergarments, but made the hot summer sun seem altogether less bothersome. Leopold stood on a rather dusty road and contemplated the building in front of him. It was obviously an inn, with a squarish wooden sign, standing at head-height, weathered and abused, announcing, rather originally and poetically, 'The Inn'. Its low white-washed walls returned the Minstrel's gaze with an expression that could only be described as stony, and windows suggested an interior that was condusive to ill-health. It brought a smile of joy to the Minstrel's lips. An oaken door stood slightly open to the north, allowing the smoky atmosphere a gasp of fresh air, and the road crept away westwards, towards the town of High-Biddleton. A fairly rocky path kept a low profile, twisting away to the south-east.




High above, Leopold could see a lantern, swinging easily in the wind.

Leopold got down on his knees and begged for help, but an absence of any response made him realise none was forthcoming.

Inside the Inn


Leopold coughed slightly as his nasal senses were attacked by a horde of scuffling smells, created by a mixture of no doubt noxious fumes. Through the hazy light, the Minstrel was just able to see a splattering of tables and chairs, arranged like the after effects of some strange and terrible sneeze. A bar propped itself up in one corner, a tired-looking barman standing behind it rubbing ineffectually at something that approximated a glass, but only because it was hollow. Shadowy figures occupied most of the other furniture, the smoke hiding their finer details, although there did appear to be a free table and stool near him. A dark and foreboding doorway was set into the east wall, a door firmly embedded into its frame. Apart from that, a huge oaken door suggested a way out, south.

stool
: 
The little stool was obviously the subject of quite a few attempts at pilfering, and had therefore been nailed quite effectively to the floor.


oaken door
: 
It wasn't portable.


foreboding door
: 
It wasn't portable.


bar
: 
It wasn't portable.


table
: 
Leopold wasn't really one to walk off with the fixtures and fittings, especially whilst shadowy figures, indeed, large menacing shadowy figures, were using them.


chair
: 
The Minstrel didn't really think he'd need a chair for the great adventuring the future held for him.


shadowy figures
: 
The Minstrel didn't suppose 
the 
shadowy figures
 would care for that.


barman
: 
The Minstrel didn't suppose 
the 
barman
 would care for that.

=== LostSheep.z5 (v5) ===




All around you, your sheep are readying themseles for sleep. They nestle in the thick grass of the large field, clearly exhausted after a hard day of grazing. But there is dissent amongst the ranks! One of your sheep makes a run for the next field, jumping gracefully over the hedgerows. You stand up quickly and collect your crook. You need that sheep!



The Bible Retold: The Lost Sheep

A light-hearted adaptation of the Parable of the Lost Sheep, by Ben Pennington.

Large, grassy field


The lush green grass of this large field makes it perfect for keeping sheep. They graze all day, but the grass never seems to thin. Through the thick hedgrerows to the west lies another of your fields and a track winds north towards Bethlehem. 



Your herd lies
 
in the middle of the field
.
 Where could the hundredth sheep have got to?

=== Mahadev.z5 (v5) ===






Light.








Streaming out of you as much as into you.








The element you live in, moving or no.








It doesn't diminish, but it sorts itself into regions, golden geographies, radiant solids.








It seems to be the fabric, force and measure of the world.








As if the ground itself were blinding sky.

Steps Of The Temple


The light takes shape, the shape of so many broad steps your eyes swim.  You can't see the edges of the steps to left and right where they taper into the distance, and the top and bottom of the flight also melt into the shining.  The golden stone they're hewn from seems hard enough to be eternal, soft enough to sink into.  The air is sumptuously cool, sweet.

The call comes through. Of all the dicks; you get the call, sitting in the front seat of your car, hands shaking on the steering wheel. An urgent call; but all you were thinking of was the bottle in the liquor store and so that's where you went first.




Now you're pulled up outside the house. The rear mirror's showing two steely eyes. You adjust your hat, stiffen up your collar and grab your badge off the dash. Here goes. You've one last chance

Broken Top Boulevard
, Outside No. 
15
 (in 
the 
black chevy
)


The boulevard 
through the windscreen 
is 
lined with ash trees, thick trunks 
casting shadows
 and gnarled roots mangling up the sidewalk. You
're sat in your car, 
parked too high up the kerb; just outside the gate to No. 15.
 Just an ordinary house.
 With a body inside.



"Homicide. One Jack Draginam, accountant. Married, no kids. Stabbed. Yadda yadda, blah blah. We got the call from the maid - geez, who has a maid? Apparently she wanted to stress there's a lot of blood."

"Oh, Inspector. Word is, if you don't crack this one, you're out of a job."


The glove compartment is 
closed
. Sat on the passenger seat is 
a 
whiskey bottle
.

As good-looking as ever. Eyes red, chin unshaved, cheek bruised. Your whole body aches like a bombsite. Oh yeah, the finest in the state.


You're wearing your trenchcoat, 
your wide-brimmed hat

and 
your scuffed black shoes

Broken Top Boulevard
, Outside No. 
15
 (in 
the 
black chevy
)


The boulevard 
through the windscreen 
is 
lined with ash trees, thick trunks 
casting shadows
 and gnarled roots mangling up the sidewalk. You
're sat in your car, 
parked too high up the kerb; just outside the gate to No. 15.
 Just an ordinary house.
 With a body inside.



The glove compartment is 
closed
. Sat on the passenger seat is 
a 
whiskey bottle
.

[ For information about this game, type ABOUT. First time players of this game are strongly urged to do this right away. ]



August, 1876


"Men!" you snap at no one in particular as you hurry down the sidewalk. Up ahead you see Mrs. Jenkins take one look at you and head to the opposite side of the street, while Mr. Tutman and Mr. Lester look up from their checker game in front of the barber's shop and chuckle.


"Poor Sean..." you hear one of them say as you hurry on by. Poor Sean, indeed. They have no idea.


In your mind, you can still hear the investor's patronizing voices. "While we are sure you are quite capable, Miss Kelley," one had chuckled, "we really must speak with your uncle about financial matters such as these. You do understand."


Understand? Oh yes, you understand all too well. Never mind that it's your money, that you're the one who's really in charge of the business, handling the ordering, the hiring, keeping things running as smoothly as when your father held the reins. No, none of that matters. When it comes to talking money, a woman's place is... elsewhere. Men.


You stomp up the stairs of your uncle's favorite club, thrust open the outer door and step inside, already rehearsing today's lecture on promptness. The way things are shaping up, you can tell it's going to be a good one.

Lucky Strike Lobby


Dark stained oak paneling with well-polished brass knobs and rails attempt to give this smoky room a dignity it doesn't deserve. Rich detailing aside, this is the doorstep to depravity, and the less time you spend here, the better. For those who think otherwise, there is a plush red sofa against the far wall, positioned directly under a life sized painting of Ulysses S. Grant. To the south is an oak door leading outside. To the north is a glass door leading to the main room.


Good, the lobby is empty. Moving quickly, you cross the polished oak floor toward the inner sanctum door, praying that this time you can extract your uncle without making a scene.


"May I help you?" comes Simon's voice from the shadows. Rats. Just once today, couldn't something go your way? The doorman tosses a hat and coat on the sofa then hurries over, stationing himself in front of the glass door. "I'm sorry Miss Amelia, but you know the rules. Gentlemen only."

You are seething, absolutely seething. With your factory desperate for capital to cover some unexpected shipping losses, with financial disaster just days away when payments come due, with three willing investors just a few miles away, sitting there with cash in hand, where is your Uncle Sean? Playing cards. Once again you wonder what your father was thinking when made out his will. In making his brother trustee, he could only have thought he would live forever. 




You are carrying
 
nothing
.
 
You are wearing 
a pair of
 
shoes
, 
a pair of
 
stockings
 and 
a 
dress
.

[-->]

A dreaming, curled up tight, drifts nowhere in a straight line, a ballistic path (though gravity's say in the matter is hard to hear above all the noise). Half-imagined stories, half-remembered people sail by, fish-eye-lensing, and fragmenting into a sonorous black. 

An insistent hand has been shaking you by the shoulder, and though you've managed to ignore it all this time, it's suddenly and jarringly unbearable. Angrily you turn round and the world shrinks around your face.

'What am I?'



Cold, thirsty, immobile


Queasy yellow light and sour smells -- the acrid plastic smell of synthetic clothing and human closeness. You cough, you sweat, you nervously shake, but you do not move. You cannot. Something stiflingly close to you, something cold, clamps you down.

Cold, thirsty, immobile


Even with your eyes forced wide open all you can see is a dim yellow haze -- no pattern, no texture, no shapes. You are closely held on all sides by something cool but gently yielding.



Now what?


=== Mercy.z5 (v5) ===


You see, when the scientists had thought that the only smallpox around was in a very very small box kept securely closed, they were wrong.

When you come into the clinic today, seven people have already died. A nurse is missing. He's probably gone, too. You think that his name was Simon.

You're probably gone too, because every time you start talking, your words keep running together and together until you start saying dadadadadadadadada and then you have to drink some more, so that you can start euthanizing again.

What a funny word, you think. What a funny world.

E-Room 2



Cinderblocks painted white surround you. The sick smell of disinfectant hangs in the stale air. Overhead is a single light that has two settings: dim for before, bright afterwards. And off. A steel table, left over from biology dissections at the community college, is in the center of the room. It's cold in here, but the thermostat near the door says it's 76. The main hallway is to the south.




Another victim lies on the steel table. His face is unrecognizable, bloated with pustules blooming pink and red. Disease is written all over his body. He's naked; it's that much worse.

E-Room 2



Cinderblocks painted white surround you. The sick smell of disinfectant hangs in the stale air. Overhead is a single light that has two settings: dim for before, bright afterwards. And off. A steel table, left over from biology dissections at the community college, is in the center of the room. It's cold in here, but the thermostat near the door says it's 76. The main hallway is to the south.




Another victim lies on the steel table. His face is unrecognizable, bloated with pustules blooming pink and red. Disease is written all over his body. He's naked; it's that much worse.



Two nurses enter and take the victim away. "Mercy, always," they say to the floor.

"Mercy, always," you intone.

The curtain lifts to a torrent of applause, as the city's gents and ladies lose their decorum for a just few moments in anticipation of something magical. The spotlights drown the glitter of sequins and pearls, the metal cane-tops and the shining buttons on the waistcoats. From where you are, centre of the boards, behind nothing but a baize table with nothing but the clothes you stand in, you are quite alone in the blinding white light.

The applause dies to a hush as they wait for you to speak.

Floodlights mark the border of the stage front, a backdrop painted like a Japanese hanging marks the back. Thick red velvet curtain droops over the wings, which lie a mile away on either side. There is nothing but you and your table, and the audience audible solely as breath held in another world.

Toaster Hill


So there's this forest that's out of the way but not too far out of the way and some folks decided to dump their old household appliances. It's tradition, now. Toaster Hill is entirely literal; it overlooks a winding road to the south with what has to be 20 or 30 old toasters.  
The flashlight
'
s reflection gives the toasters a dull, gentle glare.
 
Once you had an argument with Tommy if it was possible for something to be beautiful and ugly at the same time, and he said no, and you said Toaster Hill, and he said ok sure you're right which is weird because your arguments usually lasted longer than that.

Tangled trees whip past your face as you run, stumbling and tripping through the bushes in the forest. Your breath is coming in short gasps. Not far behind are the shouts and clatter of the men chasing you. You are a young boy, and you have just shot one of the King's deer. In your hand you clutch the piece of blue coral, snatched from the neckband of the beast.



Tangled Forest
 (
as
 
a young boy
)


You know the woods backwards, the shaded bowers, the winding roots and scurrying creatures in damp earth. But now you are lost, or not looking where you go as you run. The sunlight flickers through the green leaves like the flash of blades.  The only sounds you hear are your own laboured breathing, your pumping heart and your pursuers; getting closer.

Tangled Forest
You are a young boy, 12 years old, dressed in leather rags and wearing sandals too big for you but lashed around your feet with twine. You are panting, you are quite scared. 



You have just commited treason, and are clutching the evidence - a piece of blue coral.



There must be twenty of them, all running through the forest towards you.

...The day after, the local paper remains untouched on his doorstep. A week later friends, then neighbours, and then the police search for him in vain. After a fortnight, his wife comes to you, begging for help.

Apparently he told some cock-and-bull story about his Grandfather's will and set off, determined to hunt around a museum in the middle of the night, with only a broken old flashlight he'd found in the attic. Of course, you know that makes no sense. Old Edgar Mulldoon isn't dead; you met him last Wednesday.

Which all leaves you, with a dodgy torch of your own, set to find the idiot. It's no fun being a gumshoe.

Outside the Museum


The steps to the imposing front of the museum lead up to the north, shimmering orange in the reflection of the streetlamp's light. The facade is dull and flat like a concrete tower block but for this portico, which has a couple of sculptures. Here by your feet, for example, are a couple of stone crocuses. Further up are some gargoyles on pillars.

THE MULLDOON MURDERS
 is a brief sequel to a much, much larger previous game, 
"The Mulldoon Legacy"
 (Mulldoon.z8 in the if-archive). It was written over Christmas 2001. I'd like to thank my testers (Vincent Lynch, David Picton, Mike J. Sousa and John Bichard), everyone who enjoyed the first game over the past few years, and Sean Barrett for his varying strings compiler extension. To namecheck others who sent in suggestions: Robert Vollmert, David Wellbourn, Jason Dyer, Ben Haines, Stas Starkov, Andrew Pearce, Liz Moscato, Arild Grebstad and Al.

It is not possible to put the game into a state from which completion is impossible. However, if you deliberately - or carelessly - blow things up, throw things away, smash or leave behind objects in inaccessible places, it may not always be obvious how to undo the damage.

Bugs and comments are welcomed. I can be reached at ji207@cam.ac.uk.

Top of the Stairs


The marble walls and floor have fallen into shadow from the overhang, low over your head and near enough to touch. It is supported by two wide pillars, one either side - carved with a dragon and a unicorn. Quaint. To the north are the glass double doors of the place; there's a keypad in the wall by them. Bushes grow right up to you to the east.




The keypad looks a little dead: its screen is dark.



A 3-foot-cube packing crate sits here on the step, unopened.

Explore Murdac - a land of monsters and mysterious beings, a

world where magic holds sway and things are not what they seem.



Can you rescue the wizard's daughter, tame the lion, outwit the

Old Man of the Sea, and escape alive from the haunted house? And

what is the ultimate destiny of Frankenstein's monster?



There is treasure too in the land of Murdac - and it is indeed a

cunning adventurer who can finally fulfil his quest!



Anyway, your mission is to make off with all the loot.



I shall be your eyes and ears: instruct me with commands of one or

two words. To move, give directions (N, NE, ..., NW, U, D, B(ack)).

Other useful words include TAKE, DROP, LOOK, INV, SCORE, SAVE and

QUIT, plus some that you must discover for yourself. Good luck!

There's nothing here you can take easily.

Are you certain you want to quit?

  I wake peacefully, and already she is there. My angel - she is all around me. Her presence is like ice on water. But she is less than peaceful. My thoughts are all of raging storm clouds. Hurriedly, I drag myself up.

With
in




  I've been sleeping up here in the straw for a week now - there's the satchel, slung where I used it for a pillow - whilst we hunted, and we gathered. But none of that today. The atmosphere of the hay-loft is so dank it is hard to make my muscles move with the urgency they need, toward the long ladder down to the dusty floor of the barn, and the cattle.

Beach


You're on a beach. It's very sandy where you're standing. To the north it becomes more watery, primarily thanks to the ocean. Above the ocean is a stirring sunset, the kind that would put young couples in the mood for porking of the romantic variety. Unfortunately for you, you're on your own. High cliffs climb above you to the east and south, and a path winds through small sand dunes to the west.

see

duffle bag

You head into the ocean despite it being rather chilly. When your hips dip into the water, your testicles suddenly shoot back into your body which quickly persuades you to run back to the beach! Oh, you're a dude, by the way. I hope that doesn't make this a sexist game!

=== OnYourBack.z5 (v5) ===






So there you were, walking leisurely towards a garden full of yummy lettuce, when out of nowhere this big lumbering boy comes, picks you up, and puts you on your back! Now this might not be so bad if you were a worm or dog or something- but turtles find a bit of trouble being upside down. This looks to be a troublesome day!

Field


The field stretches all around you endlessly, or at least for a few feet, which is the extent of your vision. Being as close to the ground as you are makes it difficult to see very far. The sky reaches out in all directions below you, the soft ground and grass above you, which is an unfamiliar feeling for you, but then, you've never been stuck on your back like this before.

Stretching your neck around, you can see the underside of your shell from the first time ever. It does not look quite as hard as the top side of your shell. And it's not as round, which means you can walk when you're oriented the correct way- which you're not.

=== Ottumwa.z5 (v5) ===



This game is very loosely based on a few web searches of the real Ottumwa, and watching too much TV. 

The place: Ottumwa, Iowa, population about 25,000 and the county seat of Wapello County since 1844. It is historically known as the gateway to southeast Iowa because of its access to the Des Moines River and to the railroad. 

You have come here for a well-deserved vacation, to relax away from the pressures of your job in the big city.  By trade, you are a skilled forensics analyst working for the police department, but today you are planning on getting in some good fishing. You need to get a fishing license from the local sporting goods store.

Motel Room


A small room in an older motel. It is clean and comfortable, sparingly furnished, decorated all in neutral colors.  There is a queen-size bed, a dresser, a night stand, and a full length mirror.  The exit is to the west.

You have just finished dressing after a good night's sleep and morning toiletries. 

Enter "CREDITS" to see the game credits, or "HELP" if you want information on how to play.

FIELD


You stand in a green field containing nothing but grass and flowers. All around you is forest but in the far distance, to your north, you can see smoke rising through the trees. Life perhaps? The sun shines above bright above you. You can still smell the early morning dew on the grass and hear the songbirds in the trees.




Laying on the grass is a chest filled with your posessions.

FOREST


A mass of pines trees surround you, thin shafts of light poke through the trees, illmuninating the spot where you are standing. The forest is so dense, you can't make out anything beyond 100 metres.

The Town Square


You are standing in the  middle of a pretty town square in the center of a nondescript New England town. Like most any other nondescript New England town, there's not much to see or do here, but maybe you'll find something amusing and enjoyable to do.



A shiny metal phone booth sits in the center of the square.

You are SO NARCISSISTIC. Well, have I got a shock for you, love-bites-on-your-mirror-boy. While you're standing there admiring your oh-so-buff pecs and lats and whatever else you've spent thousands on gym fees for, a mugger sneaks up behind you. And guess what, he's got a gun! And all your fancy-ass high-tone shiny-oiled muscles don't do a damn thing against a .38 bullet as it rips through your chest. So NYAH.

You came to Livadhia as a pilgrim, looking for Trophonius, for gods and lights.  A private consultation.

No luck: the Blue Guide is vague; the man on the street doesn't know what you're talking about; and when you tried the periptero where the bus from Athens comes to its lurching halt, the owner tried to sell you tickets to the Pythia.  "Just eight thousand drachs and no waiting in line!"  

As if the sort of advice you'd get at Delphi would help.  It's all a franchise now.

So you set off on your own.  It seemed hopeless, and perhaps it was.  But one mis-step in the thigh-deep leaves, and you ended here...

Peacock Chamber


A deep chamber walled in rock.  Light descends steeply from the oculus above, leaving a spot of elliptical brilliance on the dusty ground.  The walls are panelled, to a height just level with the knee: emerald, sapphire, ovals of amethyst, shadowed and dull.

There are two exits: one ceremonial, the vast lintel capped with a triangle of empty space, which leads south; the other low and secretive, leading east.



On 
the 
altar
 is
 
a pair of
 
pinking shears
.




A heavy metal box has been shoved up against the wall, almost out of sight.

This is more a toy than a game; more than either, it's a demonstration of some thoughts I have about materials manipulation and interaction.  Tested, but not perfectly; consider it beta.

Some things to try: shaking containers; burning, cutting, and breaking objects; reading things; taking rubbings with the piece of paper.  (See also credits, about.)

If you find bugs, or have any comments of any kind, email me: emshort at mindspring.com.

Bedsit


Rachel's bedsit is small and sparsely furnished, but is certainly nicer than living at home with Mum and Dad.  Her boyfriend bought it six months ago, and although he hasn't given it to her, he's quite happy for her to treat it as her own.  It's just this one room with a tiny bathroom attached.  To go to work she'll need to go out, but not until she's dressed. 


In the room is her bed, desk and a bedside cabinet. 


A small wardrobe for her clothes is in the corner. 




There's a note pinned to the wall.


A photo hangs on one wall.

Rachel is a young woman who has been reasonably content in life.  Although not particularly attractive, she gets some attention from men, because of her curvy figure, pretty face and striking auburn hair.  She's not especially bright but copes well with her limited life.  
She's naked. 


Rachel is relaxed and happy, looking forward to meeting her boyfriend later.

Dozing lazily in the morning sun in your little hut, something suddenly makes your ears go stiff. You scan the air, trying to figure out what it was. You stretch your paws, reluctantly wag your tail, and get up.
Vigorously shaking the dust off of your fur, you have a sudden insight: the perfect shape of a bone forms in your mind. Yeah, that's it! Somewhere, somehow, there must still be a bone left from last fall. If only you could remember where it was...

Your Hut


A thin beam of sunlight illuminates this shabby hut just enough to see what a mess it really is. Wood planks wildly nailed together, frozen drops of tar on the roof serve to show what dogs are worth to their masters nowadays.
A somewhat rectangular hole in the eastern wall leads outward.




Your good old friend Blamant the Teddy is here.

=== Reddex.z8 (v8) ===






Oh damn it's another day here at your IT job. It's a very slow day, no one has called to complain that the mouse isn't working. Or possibly some other ridiculous comment on the computers. You're hoping for anything at this point. You picked up your phone for a couple of times hoping that something good would just happen. Nope, not this time. So you sit back in the chair. Giving a big sigh you put your hands on the keyboard, ready to type something. You aren't sure what to type though. On the screen the web browser is opened to a search engine. You just stare at the screen, it becomes only a bright blur.




An hour has passed you must have dozed off. You hear your phone go off. You pick it up rather excitedly. The message simply reads: "Go visit reddex.app." A little confused you just sit there. you say aloud "What the hell why not!" You position your hands, and type out the sites address. It takes a couple of seconds to load. And that's when it happened... Dammit! it's one of those cliche text adventure games.

Dark forest


After a few seconds of complete darkness your eyes begin to clear. You find yourself in a dark forest. A low glow is what provides the light. It isn't great to see correctly. After a minute of adjusting your eyes, it becomes easier to see at this low, near darkness.




This is a Forest, which is all around you. Tall and tangled trees is all that you can see. You walk around for a bit and nearly stumble over an object on the ground. You look down and see that it's a lamp.




N/S/e/W.




The lamp is next to you.

You are finally at home. Those parties at Stifler's always drive your stomach mad. Drinks of all kind, kindly mixed by Slacks, the favourite barkeeper. With those drinks, it's always the same bad thing: At least 60% alcohol, rest either alcohol or some alcoholic beverage. Only food served: chips. chili chips. Lighting farts is one of your favourite hobbys at these events. But sometimes, some 'hardware' finally presses down your guts to reach fresh air. Then, always around four in the morning, it's time to go home. Luckily, your one room apartement isn't far away from stifler's, so you get here after about five minutes of fresh walking. As it is the fact with walking, it does a good job in driving the bowels down further...


Type help for help.

Big Crowded Room (Your Home)


Your only place to hangout alone on this whole fucking world. Alas, as you aren't the clean type of man, the first thing that comes in view after entering here is the floor. Or, to be more precise, the things covering the floor. However, as they are mostly litter or far to messy to be of use ever again, you don't have to pay any attention at all to them.
You eye around the walls and get hold of the other ingredients for your thing called room:
A computer, sitting on a large oak wood desk in the back wall of the room, right next to a huge, dirty window. To the left, a bed with a once clean covering and a closet full of things which resembled clothes once upon a time. To your right, an oven tries to hide masses of roaches, while the old fridge next to it tries to keep it's door closed in spite of the enormous pressure resulting in at least four different chemical reactions taking place in there. Before the fridge, an old cupboard catches dust. This is your home, though, and it wouldn't be complete without a bathroom. So, to the south is the door leading to this holy place of mankind, while the door through which you walked in here is to the west.

 Credits


Graham Nelson and Andrew Plotkin have made many contributions to our world. Without Inform and "Lists and Lists" this game would not be. 

Larry Kwong tested "Informatory" and suggested it be made into an honest tutorial. This is the result. 

Jennifer Vaughan, Neil Cerutti, and Barbara Wood tested the game. They earned their many thanks.



 Notes


This game may not work at all on some versions of the Z-Machine since it relies on some obscure features that may not have been implemented or may have been improved away. See the appendix on Z-Machines in the Book of Inf. It does work on WinFrotz. If you get a crash when attempting to create or modify objects, try the split command as discussed near the end of Section 104 of the Book of Inf. 

All comments will be gratefully received. They should be sent to shlaer@aol.com.

You worked hard to get here. You studied late, saved the money from your part time jobs, and listened endlessly to your mother's hopes for you. She sacrificed to help you in your quest, and boy did she let you know it. Finally, the admission letter arrived. 

You have never really been away from home before, just trips to nearby towns for high school games. But now, two days of travel by coach train are over. The city is a new experience for you, strange and wonderful and busy. It is an old city, not large, and it wears its age with grace and pride. You make your way through the twisting streets, and at last you enter the campus. 

You won admission; you have the creased letter with you on this great day. This is your first day of school.

To get started, look at the admission letter in your possession.



Leafy Quadrangle


This pleasant, grassy quadrangle is shaded by magnificent trees. Peaceful, almost cloistered, it eases your nervous excitement with a sense of serenity and high purpose. It is everything you had imagined the campus of a renowned institution of higher learning would be. 

The entrance to the distinguished, ivy covered, administration building lies directly east, and there is an inviting path winding around the building to the southeast. The impressive archway of the campus gate stands to the west. Beyond the gate is the muted bustle of the city and its myriad attractions.

You wake up in a room that appears to be spinning clockwise. The room stops spinning long enough for you to think a moment. Who are you? Where are you? Why are you here? Who threw up on you? Suddenly, you remember . . . there was a party last night . . . there was a dude at the party . . . the guy gave you some pills and put you in here . . . this is the back room of the party! Well, you know where you are and how you got here, but two important questions remain.  Who are you and, more importantly, who the hell threw up on you?

Back bedroom


This back bedroom looks as if a bunch of horny teenagers just drank beer, smoked pot, and made out with their girlfriends in here, which is probably the case. The room is scattered with Women's undergarments, beer cans, small puddles of vomit, cigarette butts, empty ziplock baggies and (ugh!) used condoms. The smell of spilled bong water pervades the air, making you wrinkle your nose in disgust. Doorways lead south, west, and east.




The bag of pot you bought from your dealer lies on the green and gold shag carpeting among a few burned matchsticks and some beer cans.

=== SoFar.z8 (v8) ===




Hot, foul, and dark. How did indoor theater become so fashionable? Well enough in spring rain or winter, but not in the thick, dead afternoon of high summer. And though 
Rito and Imita
 looks very fine, shining with electric moonslight in the enclosed gloom, you're much more aware of being crammed in neck-by-neck with your sweaty fellow citizens.


Damn the crowd, in truth: your mood was hot, foul, and dark when you sat down. Aessa was supposed to meet you here. She's made excuses before, and you don't think about what it might mean. Try not to think, rather. Just watch the story. One of your favorites. But it's miserably hot, and you just aren't caught up in the play...

Lower Theater
 (
on
 
the 
bench
)


If nothing else, you have a good seat.
 The stage is only a few rows to the north.
 People are jammed on benches in every direction; you think the aisle is somewhere to the west.



The play is into the final act. Rito has finally found out about Imita's affair, and he stalks the stage, whipping voice and hands about himself. A footfall behind him; he turns, and sees Imita. She backs a step at the force of his gaze.

Just you, as usual.



The players continue....


   
Rito:

   How come you, harlot? Dare you come this way,

   your skin yet dark with Tato's shadow's stain?


   
Imita:

   Young lord, I will not kneel. And shadowed dark,

   or white with rays of moon or sun or moon,

   my flesh is mine. Or nearly so; I find --


   
Rito:

   Say on! What more has hated Tato done?


You shake your head, trying to net your straying thoughts, and catch a flash of copper hair. A few rows back, by the aisle -- Aessa couldn't have shown up and 
not
 seen you, could she? She wouldn't be avoiding you.

So Far
 is copyright 1996 by Andrew Plotkin. It may be copied, distributed, and played freely.


This is a shortish-to-medium-sized game. More than a short story, less than a full-length novel. Its rating is "cruel." It is possible to make mistakes which will prevent you from winning. Sometimes common sense will serve to avoid such mistakes; sometimes insight is necessary; sometimes neither will help. Save often, and keep your old saved games.


Do not expect 
So Far
 to be anything like 
A Change in the Weather.
 It's not.

Imita:

   Imita's put him by; he's naught and gone --

   But nearly, for she carries Tato's son.

An illusion, you're not sure. You only are here because some postboy came to your door with a letter from Jen, talking about some form of interference. But you have no idea. To cut a long story short, here you are. So you drive through the streets and arrive at this low-down place. Your objective: meet Jen in the backyard.

=== SundayAfternoon.z8 (v8) ===










July, 1892.




Father is off to Oxford again, and Mother's gone with him.  You know what that means: another day in the care of Uncle Stephen, who is nice but boring, and Aunt Emma, who means well but won't let you do anything fun.  Worst of all, it's a Sunday, which means you're sitting very upright in Aunt Emma's parlour, in all your stiff-starched Sunday best, trying to read Uncle Stephen's latest sermon about one of the less-interesting parts of the Bible while Aunt Emma pretends that she wouldn't rather be knitting and Uncle Stephen hides under a pile of Hebrew and Latin and Greek in his study.




Plus, it's gloriously sunny outside, and you can smell the grass from in here.  It's just not fair.  All the servants have the day off because Uncle Stephen and Aunt Emma don't believe in making people do any real work on Sundays, and you can bet that they -- Janet and Morris and Cookie, each of whom is loads more fun than Uncle Stephen and Aunt Emma put together -- are probably not all cooped up indoors in their Sunday best.




If only there were some way you could escape....

Parlour
 (in 
the 
armchair
)


The parlour is Aunt Emma's domain, and is wonderfully comfortable and cosy on cold winter nights, especially when there's a fire going in the fireplace.  On warm summer afternoons, however, it gets stiflingly claustrophobic
.




You are ensconced in an armchair near the fireplace
.  Escape seems most likely either east into the hall or north into the dining room.




From her portrait above the fireplace mantel, Queen Victoria gazes benignly down on the room.




Aunt Emma sits by the window, 
dutifully reading her Bible
.

July, 1892
You've been thoroughly scrubbed and ironed and starched into your least comfortable set of clothes.  One day, when you are either Prime Minister or Archbishop of Canterbury -- depending on whether you listen to Mother or Father -- you're going to outlaw starch or declare it anathema or both.

Parlour
 (in 
the 
armchair
)


The parlour is Aunt Emma's domain, and is wonderfully comfortable and cosy on cold winter nights, especially when there's a fire going in the fireplace.  On warm summer afternoons, however, it gets stiflingly claustrophobic
.




You are ensconced in an armchair near the fireplace
.  Escape seems most likely either east into the hall or north into the dining room.




From her portrait above the fireplace mantel, Queen Victoria gazes benignly down on the room.




Aunt Emma sits by the window, 
dutifully reading her Bible
.

Your horse went lame five miles back, so you had to leave him at some peasant's farm and continue the journey on foot. It would have been tempting to rest awhile, accepting the peasant's rustic hospitality, but the king's orders were explicit - make for Swineback Ridge with the minimum of delay. Weary though you are from battling against rebels in the east, the king insisted that he needs 
you
 here, to take command of the hopelessly outnumbered army up on the ridge ahead, an army that's your homeland's last, best hope to turn back the barbarian hordes and avoid the fall of night.

For the tenth time today you wonder about the urgency. The last you heard General Chorza was in command of the army up on the ridge, and you know Chorza of old, a fine soldier and a good commander. So what is it that Chorza cannot handle himself?




Dusty Path


The long dusty path leads through untended fields up towards Swineback Ridge to the north.  To the south it leads back into the heartlands of the Kingdom of Lorayne, the land you are determined to defend at all costs against the barbarian hordes of the Phartipu. A narrow lane leads off across the fields to the east.

Tired, aching and battle-scarred, you are still Captain-General Yelanor, the best military commander in the land (though you say it yourself) and your country's last, best hope for victory.

Dusty Path


The long dusty path leads through untended fields up towards Swineback Ridge to the north.  To the south it leads back into the heartlands of the Kingdom of Lorayne, the land you are determined to defend at all costs against the barbarian hordes of the Phartipu. A narrow lane leads off across the fields to the east.

   ------------------------------             
           
           
   Here stands the Great Machine;                    
   Its eyes are gold and silver,                    
   And its name is Urizen.                    
                       
                       
   THE ARGUMENT                    
                       
   The Great Machine!                    
   Ever does it turn, marching forward into eternity,                    
   Turning the blood of men into history;                    
   Caught in its terrible gears, the world wails;                    
   Turning, turning, ever turning:                    
   The end is marked by a wheel of fire.

     you wake up              



   'Get up!'                    
   Your eyes are still closed. You feel weary, and dirty. Your mouth is filled with slime, as if you'd just drowned in some god-forsaken swamp

   'Get the fuck up!'                    
   You open your eyes. You're in a tent, and a man in a military uniform is standing above you, looking down angrily. You feel disoriented. You're not supposed to be here. It's dark, and ugly, and cold. You can hear the rain outside. This is no place for a man.                    
   But you're still here, always here - there is no way out until the war is won, and the war never ends. This is not a mistake. This is your life in hell.  
   'Oh, so you're awake. Now will you get up, or do I have to kick you?'

On the whole, it was worth the trip. The plains really were broad and grain-gold, if scarred with fences and agricultural crawlers. The mountains were overwhelming. And however much of the capital city is crusted with squat brick and faceless concrete hulks, there are still flashes of its historic charm. You've seen spires above the streets -- tiny green parks below tenements -- hidden jewels of fountains beyond walls. Any bland alley can conceal balconies wrought into iron gardens, fiery mosaics, a tree or bed of flowers nurtured by who knows who.


This alley, however, is a total washout. It ends in flat bare dirty brick, and you've found nothing but a door which lacks even the courtesy of a handle. Maybe you should call it a day.

End of Alley


It's a narrow dead end here, with walls rising oppressively high in three directions. The alley is quite empty, bare even of trash.
 (Your guidebook warned you: the
 police are as efficient about litter laws as about everything else they do.) You can retreat to the south.



A plain metal door faces you to the east, near the alley's end
. It's firmly shut
.

End of Alley
Spider And Web
 is copyright 1997-8 by Andrew Plotkin. It may be copied, distributed, and played freely.


For acknowledgements and credits, please type "credits".


An introductory note: To simplify the problem of dialogue in interactive fiction, the "tell" and "ask" commands are not used in this game. Your conversational options are limited to "yes," "no," and saying nothing at all. Trust me -- this isn't as big a deal as it sounds.


Also, after some consideration, I have decided not to implement body parts -- head, arms, legs, hands -- as separate objects. If you feel a desire to refer to yourself, "me" will suffice.


It is possible to make a fatal mistake in this game, but you will immediately know you have done so. You can always "undo" after death, and then fix the mistake. Therefore, the game is best played straight through. Accept any non-fatal mistakes that you may make; you will have a second chance. If you back up and replay each scene for maximum efficiency, avoiding all mistakes, certain aspects of the game will be lost.


However -- you will eventually reach a point where things become dangerous. You'll know when. Beyond that, you're playing for keeps and heartbeats count. Save early and often.


Do not expect 
Spider And Web
 to be anything like 
So Far
 or 
A Change in the Weather.
 It's not. In a certain sense, this is my first conventional game. In another sense, it's the strangest game I know, and understanding what's happening is entirely your problem.


This game is free. But if you feel like sending me money, I won't refuse. If you feel like sending me comments or bug reports, I'll be ecstatic. As of the beginning of 1998, I am at

=== TheDayIShotHitler.z5 (v5) ===






 Dear Blogreaders, 


 yesterday was the strangest day of my life! The things I have seen - and done - it was so strange...so horrible. And yet, wonderful. You remember that guy from the Psychology course? Paul? We had a date the day before yesterday. Some people already emailed me with questions regarding how it went. But sorry, especially to you, Toby43, but I was to tired, and, honestly, toO drunk to go online that night. I'll skip that part, maybe I'll write about it later, because I have to tell you what went down this night. Paul was throwing this big New-Years-Eve  party and he invited me (of course, I may add with what little self-esteem I have), to help him organize - and stay overnight.


 That's how it all started. I arrived in the midst of the party, because I was visiting my family before that. So when I went in the door, Paul rushed at me. I couldn't have anticipated what happened next, that this would turn into...

Paul, his brown hair in a cute pony-tail, rushes at you, a huge bowl of eggnog in his hand. He told you yesterday that he prepared it carefully after some old family recipe. He looks at you in utter horror, squeaking: "Mice."


"Of me to drop by?"


"No, Mice. They were in the house yesterday, and now one is in my eggnog." His voice is but a whisper.


"Hm, throw it away?" you suggest carefully.


"No, Alex, everyone is waiting for it. Also, the noodles haven't arrived yet and the sandwiches are disappearing rapidly.So people need something to feed on." 


Right at that moment, the head of a small mouse pokes out of the liquid. The little bugger looks around, then begins to swim around quite happily.


"Get rid of these foul vermin! Save my eggnog."


You both look down on the swimming mouse. "And please don't hurt the poor little creature." With that, Paul disappears into the living room, leaving the bowl in your hands.




hallway


A small hallway, brightly lit by a row of neon lights. Dark wooden stairs lead upwards, and a doorframe opens west into the Living Room. A small door under the stairs lead into a storage closet. (Referred to by Paul only as "The Potter Room".)


Your steps don't make any sound on the the thick, red carpet.

Thanks first:


 Jacqueline, for organizing this SpeedIF.


 Jota, for making the games Floyd-compatible.


 Katre, for hosting the MUD.


 Everyone on the MUD, for help in the two days it took writing this game. 




 The only difference in this game is that you have to TALK TO people. Makes it easier. And doesn't make any difference. 




 Some of the humour in this game might be a bit offensive. Honestly, I'm not sure. This is version 2.0, some bugs removed.




The extravagantly long cutscenes have not been tempered with.

=== TheGarlicCage.z8 (v8) ===






It is top secret. It is deadly. It is the ultimate war weapon. It smells like garlic.


You wake up. You can't anything. You can't remember last night. It smells like Garlic all around you. You panic to find that you are in a glass room, about 200 square meters, without any doors. Beyond the cage, you see a room painted entirely white. You hit the glass but it seems to be the hardest glass you've ever seen. You moan.

Garlic Cage


There is a strange smell of garlic that infects everything, including yourself, growing stronger every second.




There is a small Cardboard piece hanging from the ceiling. It smells like garlic.




On 
the 
Cardboard Plate
 
is
 
a 
Rock
.




There is a bin here. It smells like garlic.




There is a rusty, old looking wire lying around. It seems interesting - perhaps you should take notice of it.

=== TheGrandQuest.z5 (v5) ===







You've spent the best part of your life as a man dreaming of the goblet. Its history stretches back through the ages, featuring in one legend here, another there, and always as the centre of events. Those who behold it are cursed or blessed, for it is the beginning of their true lives, marking the end of the mundane, and the start of the fantastical.

Here and there are decayed bits of foliage, and other assorted debris. In one corner, an animal seems to have made a nest of some kind.

To perform an action with an object, use a verb, the object and the appropriate prepositions.


Examples:  TAKE FISH.  OPEN BOX.  TURN ON TV.  SCREAM AT SHADOWS.  WAVE AT PRINCE OF WALES.  VANDALISE ARTWORK.  READ NECRONOMICON.


Note that you can abbreviate the object names slightly, but the adjectives are used to make distinctions between objects with similar names.


To perform an action involving direct and indirect objects, both objects are required in the appropriate order with a preposition linking them.


Examples:  GIVE BOX TO MAN.  THROW STONE AT PLATE.  EAT SPAGHETTI WITH FORK.  CUT RUG WITH SWORD.  BEHEAD TRAITOR WITH RAZOR-SHARP POSTCARD.  BURN TAPESTRY WITH BLOWTORCH.


Another useful command is UNDO, which will move the game back one turn, like a pre-release time warp device.


The OOPS command has a similar effect, replacing an incorrect word in a previous command with the word following it.


Examples:  PICK UP KINFE.  OOPS KNIFE.  FIRE BAZOKA.  OOPS BAZOOKA.


QUIT allows to to leave the game, SAVE and RESTORE can be used to save and restore games, and RESTART will allow you to start over.

Entrance Room

You cautiously make your way north. You emerge from the shadows, and a gate crashes shut behind you. No way back. And all the supplies are with the horse.




Poetry Room


The walls here are made of stone, covered in runes. Most of them are meaningless to you, except for an inscription above the gate to the north.




A series of cushioned stools are placed in a semi-circle.




There is a clicking noise from the ceiling, followed by the sound of breathing.

=== TheInvestment.z5 (v5) ===


The year is 20XX, and the economy is in shambles. The market has fallen to its' knees, despite every effort on the part of the government and investors. Now, desperation is spreading amongst the people like a plague, with pressure building to find any way to save the market from utterly collapsing. Stock buybacks, pouring trillions in liquidity into the market, bailouts, tax cuts.. 

It's the start of a new day, what ought to be just another typical Tuesday on Wall Street. 
Today, however, the knowledge that you have been chosen burdens you greatly.

Your Bedroom


A small, mostly barren room, you use for sleeping, and checking up on the state of the world when here at home. The only illumination comes from your open computer which sits on a small desk. On the wall with your window hangs two pictures, one of your best friend, and another of your parents. Also here is your old mattress which sits on the cold hard floor. The solitary exit is to the south.




There 
is 
a 
black cloak
 here.

In the Ballroom


Four other people stand around the room, all staring at you for an answer. Mr Bromelle stands in the left corner by the maroon colored curtains with a large window behind him. It is a dark night outside. Mr Kalburry is over at the piano, playing an unmatched beautiful melody. Sharon sits on the cherry wood coffee table with a lit cigarette in her mouth. Every few seconds she takes a puff and then gives you a nasty look. Jack Haultairya is near the right side door, perched on one foot leaning up against the wall. He has a hand on the holster for his gun and the other with a lighter that he continuously flicks open and closed; flame then no flame. A roaring fire crackles behind you with a sudden 
hiss 
every once in a while. On the wall is a clock that makes a short ticking sound as if foreboding the moment when the time hits midnight. On the floor is a body, covered in blood with a bullet hole straight through his head.

Smaller Bedroom
 (on 
the 
bed
)


This is the smaller of your two bedrooms.  You've been sleeping here for close to a year.  A small wardrobe contains your folded clothes, a shallow closet your hanging clothes.  A window looks to the east
, or would if it weren't curtained
.  Doorways go north, into the other bedroom, and southwest, into your living room.  
The door to the bathroom stands open to the south.

The Valley House
 is puzzle-free interactive fiction.  The story (such as it is) will proceed without your help, or you can try to discover the activities that push it forward.  There's time to look around you and explore your surroundings - cursorily or in detail - in the spaces between time transitions.  The game will carry you through a day, in some ways a typical day, in other ways not.  How much you discover about the nature of this day, and your part in it, is up to you.

=== The_Computer_Lady.z8 (v8) ===






Right, calm down. You've had your computer (an Apple II) since the mid 90s, before you could actually buy them at Apple Stores. It's so old now that the modem for connecting you to the internet has failed, and it's screen is cracked at the top where you hit it in your frustration because your favourite game from 1987, Bureaucracy, by Douglas Adams crashed before you could even load it. (The author of this game wasn't born in the 1990s, so he's only guessing that Apple II's had modems. Mind you, the latest MacBook has a thing called WiFi.) So, with that background out of the way, you took your ancient relic of a computer (it should be in a museum) to the Computer Lady in the hope that they could repair such machines.

You are a novice writer of interactive fiction. It all started when you had finished playing Jigsaw, a rather interesting historical game with references to Infocom's Trinity. Now though, as you stand there holding your Apple II, thoughts of your next IF game in your mind, you wonder if you should have just bought yourself an iPhone.

Entrance


This is the entrance of The Computer Lady, which repairs computers, software and just might, put your computer in a museum along with those old-fashioned record players and video cassettes. To the south, the street can be seen, a reminder that you can get back home whenever you want. To the east is the main office, west is the conference room and north is the place you go if you need to answer the call of nature. A sign is attached to the east wall.

=== The_Fifth_Continent.z8 (v8) ===






Ever since you were young, you've been curious about the Romney Marsh, an area of Kent where the people seem to farm sheep, bell ring and goodness knows what. You've even heard a rumour that smuggling went on there during the 18th century, but that's now in the past. So, you pick up your tourist rucksack and, after checking out the various reviews on TripAdvisor, you are on your way.

Church Approach


You are standing on Church Approach, which is a little side street off New Romney high street. Opposite you is St Nicholas Church, where the good people of New Romney enjoy bell ringing. Nearby is Station Road, where the Marsh Academy (formally called Southland's School) is. To your north is The Computer Lady. Being a tourist by trade, the picnic bench to the northeast seems to be as important to you as a piece of homework that you did ages ago. However, the high street to the east seems more alive, so you might find more interesting things there.

Hello" player


If you find yourself giving up playing this game, I can understand. Interactive fiction can be hard to play, partly because it is only played by a handful of people these days, and partly because no one outside the IF community seems to play it. So, the author of this game would like to help you out. If you don't want help, you're on your own.


Here are some useful words that you could try typing into the game. They are all in capitals


Try EXAMINE, going in a compass direction (i.e. NORTH, SOUTH, EAST or WEST), or, you could check out what you are carrying by typing INVENTORY or I. WAIT (or Z) will allow you to wait for something, but you won't be moving. This is very useful if you are waiting for a car to stop on a busy road. LOOK will describe what is in a room (note rooms in interactive fiction games can be either outside or inside). If you would like to try some magic, type XYZZY and you'll be transported to Church Approach, which is where the game began. If you come across a container, that is, anything that can be opened, type OPEN (container). To quit the game, type QUIT. To save, type SAVE. To restore the game (for exampple, you might like to go back to a saved position), type RESTORE.


Right, that's it. I can't think of anything else to say. You could try asking questions on some of the forums run by the IF community, or go to ifmud.port4000.com. You can type HELP at any time during your game.

The intercom crackles to life. "This is your captain speaking. We're jumping to hyperspace shortly, so for your protection, we've locked all stateroom doors. As soon as we've safely jumped, your doors will open and you will be free to move about the ship."

Stateroom


Staterooms aboard a spaceship, even one as luxurious as the Thaleia, are tight, cramped affairs, and this one is no exception. There is barely enough room for you and the furniture. The door to the hallway is locked tight for now. East is your bathroom.




Robutler stands attentive to your needs.

=== TimeForTea.z8 (v8) ===






The sun shines down on the city of Whitstone, and the great clock in Steeping Square strikes four.  Along with just about everyone else in the city, you head out to find your afternoon tea.  It's a good thing, too, because you were just starting to get the shakes...

Buxenhall Gardens


Buxenhall Gardens is, at least during the summer months, the most popular teahouse in Whitstone.  Patrons in fancy dress mill about, exchanging the latest gossip and sipping the finest of imported teas.  Numerous tables and divans are arrayed about the gardens in a studied fashion: pleasingly disordered, yet still allowing easy passage for women in wide skirts.




An unoccupied plush sofa looks quite inviting.

Time for Tea is a game about tea, cakes, and deadly secrets, written for the 2nd Annual Metafilter Interactive Fiction Contest.  This game is based on a One-Page Dungeon by the same name by Clarabelle Chong, who gave the creation of this game her blessing via email.  All failures in the execution of the concept are, of course, the fault of the present author, and not Mrs. Chong.  Many thanks are also due to Cislyn, known as lriG rorriM at Metafilter, for finding many errors during playtesting. 




 The descriptions of alchemical symbols scattered throughout the game are mostly verbal descriptions of real alchemical emblems from the 16th through the 19th centuries, which I found at 
www.alchemywebsite.com
.  It would have been nice to include them as "feelies," but the scans there are under copyright. 




 The game uses the standard interactive fiction commands, with one or two extras:


 "x (something)" to look at something,


 "get (something)" to pick something up,


 "i" to see what you are carrying,


 "drop (something)" to drop something,


 "search (something)" to really poke around at something,


 n, s, e, w, ne, se, sw, nw, u, and d to move from place to place,


 and "socialize" to talk to random strangers in a crowded place, such as a tea house or port. 




 Interacting with people is done entirely with the command "ask (someone) about (topic)."  I've done my best to interpret lots of topics and include pointers to things that the characters might be willing to talk about.  But, because my fore-sight is not perfect, if an obvious topic doesn't work, try a couple synonyms. 




 A couple of objects in the game hold information.  For these objects, you can "consult (something) about (topic)." 




 Many objects in the game have descriptions that change each time you examine them.  Likewise, sometimes asking a person about a topic more than once will create a different result.  These people and objects are all set up to cycle through a list of possibilities, and then repeat once you've seen them all. 




 Finally, the game has a hint system built in, but you'll have to solve the first puzzle before you can use it. 




 Being a game about secrets, there is (at least!) one solution, but simply finishing the game doesn't mean you've found it.  Can you piece together the clues to figure out what dark secrets plague the city of Whitstone? 




 Have a good time, and try not to get yourself killed. 


-kaibutsu, 2010.

[Press any key]


The seat is hard and the popcorn is tasteless. A pair of teenagers play-fight in the back row -  they probably sneaked in without paying. A distressingly huge and sweaty bulk lowers itself into the seat next to yours, engulfing the armrest.

This had better be worth it!
The teenagers snort at some whispered wisecrack.

Suddenly the lights dim. The murmur of conversation dies away and all eyes turn toward the screen...

Shadowed streets writhe with colour and movement. A tide of pedestrians flows through gorges of concrete and glass, rippling and eddying against the store-fronts.

In the backwater of a street cafe sits an English newspaper. The pages lower and we catch a first glimpse of our hero, reading an editorial over his bowl of soup.




A Streetside Cafe


The man sits at an outdoor table surrounded by swirling crowds. He turns a page of his newspaper and takes a sip from a bowl of steaming soup.

A Streetside Cafe


The man sits at an outdoor table surrounded by swirling crowds. He turns a page of his newspaper and takes a sip from a bowl of steaming soup.

=== Transporter.z5 (v5) ===

What a day! You slump down onto your cosy armchair and play around with the rubber buttons on the remote control. Realizing the lack of interest on television, you utter a sigh.

Suddenly you feel rather dizzy, the room seems to spin around. You move to stand up and realize your not in your livingroom anymore, but now floating around in space with swirls of colours and stars spinning around you as far as the eye can see. You feel yourself being sucked towards a blinding bright light in the distance. You float closer and closer till you have to shut your eyes from the light, suddenly your hear a swishing noise then all is quiet.


Opening your eyes you are shocked to find yourself in a completely different place. You are now standing inside a machine of some kind, with an opening to one side leading out into an unfamiliar room. Looking at you from a rocking chair in the room seems to be a wizard.

He looks at you in horror for a second. "Oh my God what have I done! I didn't mean to bring you here. And now look the energy diamond is worn out." he says holding up a large black lump of something in his hands.


Dazed you step out of the machine and into the room. The wizard then explains about his transporter machine malfunctioning and accidentally bringing you here. "Look your going to have to get another diamond which will power the transporter to take you home, there's bound to one around somewhere. Here take this backpack, you never know it might save your life one day if your wearing it. Well what are you waiting for? Go and find a diamond for me then."

Bedroom


You are in a fairly large bedroom, which is filled with all sorts of bottles and potions on shelves lined along the walls. Sunlight streams in through a glass window making the glass bottles glint and sparkle. In one corner is the transporter machine, which looks like a large sort of metal box with wires, dials and lights on. There are switches and other devices externally connected to it, which all looks far to complex for you. You can't see a bed or other bedroom furniture, only an old wooden rocking chair.




In the south wall is a closed wooden door.



An old wizard sits in the rocking chair smiling at you.
 He suddenly asks "Have you brought me a diamond yet?"

                       HELP WITH TRANSPORTER


To move about use commands like "EAST", "WEST", "UP", "IN", etc or just use "E", "W", "U", for short. You can also jump, stand on things, push, pull, turn, listen, smell, take <object>, drop <object>, throw, open, close, unlock, etc to help you in the game.


If you meet someone you can talk to them by using "SAY <something> TO <person>" or just "<person>, <something>". You can also give the person an object or "ASK <person> ABOUT <something>" who's answer might help you.


Many commands are shortened for less typing. For example, you can type "I" instead of "INVENTORY" (which displays the list of objects your carrying), "X <object>" instead of "EXAMINE <object>", "L" instead of "LOOK".


If you've had enough typing "QUIT" will end your adventure. To just save the current game to disk just type "SAVE", and you load a game type "RESTORE".


To see how your getting along in the game type "SCORE". For a more detailed score type "FULLSCORE". These commands and loading and saving do not take up any turns in the game.


Remember your quest is to get back home and perhaps taking a reward home with you as well.


   GOOD LUCK!!

Hello there!

So you are new to Interactive Fiction? You don't even really know what Interactive Fiction is?

Interactive Fiction is a genre of computer games that rely pretty much on text: what happens in the game, the description of the locations and your instructions are all text-based.

How such a thing is played?

Well, I'm here to help you. I'm the Tutorial Guide. We're going to play a very small game together, so that you can hurry back to enjoy the main game.

Tutorial Room


You wake up in a strange room, with no idea how you got there. Were you kidnapped? Did you get drunk? What happened?


The room is small and poorly lighted. 
You can't see anything, except that there is a lamp in a nightstand by the bed.
 



The preceding text is the description of your location, but this time it's not very helpfull since you're in the dark. We should try to switch on the lamp and give the room a better look.

Try it: type "
switch the lamp on
" and press ENTER
.

=== UnderTheBed.z8 (v8) ===










For seven years you have lain in your bed, terrified of the night. Lying in the center of your bed, where the monster couldn't reach you, you waited in horror for the day. Your mom and dad didn't believe that there were monsters. They even checked. You had resigned that this would be your life.




Then your baby brother was born. For a while he slept in mom and dad's room, but now he's been moved into the crib in your room. And now the monster found an easier target. That's when you decided that it ends tonight. You've decided that tonight you will kill the monster. . .




Under the Bed


Your baby brother's last chance.

=== UniPool.z5 (v5) ===




It is late afternoon, and the previously busy market place now has only a few stragglers trying to find last-minute bargains.
 Your stall is now devoid of all the home-grown delights that were piled on the table, and you are preparing to pack things away and return to your house.
It seems that Giles, next stall along, (for whom you have a secret fondness,) has also had a good day.  He stands, with the last remaining apple tree sapling that he has left for sale.
 You look shyly towards him, but all his attention is taken up gazing at Grace, the beautiful daughter of the local squire who approaches Giles' stall.

Hardly sparing a glance at the tree she throws some money at Giles' feet and instructs him to deliver it immediately to the Hall. 
 She sweeps away with a wiggle and a show of shapely leg below her silk gown, and Giles trots along obediently behind her like a faithful dog.

The Market Square


The market place has stalls arranged around its perimeter.    
The north side of the square is bordered by the entrance gate and boundary wall of the Hall, the squire's residence.
Your house is along the road to the east, and the dismal bogland trail leads to the west.
The southern road leads off to the big town many miles away which is far too distant to walk to.  


It's the end of the day and there is little left to buy, and few people still browsing.

You are a hard-working girl, with mousey hair, a weathered face and labour-toughened hands.  As someone once said of you - Marty's beauty is well-concealed. 
Like most of the villagers, your clothes are home made from coarse fabric.  It may not be too comfortable, but it's what you are accustomed to.  And there's no point in wishing to dress like those rich folks at the Hall - those silks and satins wouldn't last five minutes  on the farm.

=== Vacation.z5 (v5) ===




So, it's finally time again for the long awaited skiing holiday at your cabin in the Black Forest in Germany. You have worked hard the last few months at the office in Canberra and you don't mind leaving Australia for a while.

Yesterday, you arrived in Germany and met up with your friend who lends you a car whenever you are here. The flight was terrible and the food worse. You have promised your wife and daughters that you'll try to change the return ticket to another airline. However, as you wake up the first morning at the cabin, you find that your family is gone...

Bedroom


You are in your bedroom. Most of the floor space is taken by a rather large double bed. Against the wall is a small table, in front of which is a chair. In one corner of the room is a large closet. A door leads southwest.



On 
the 
table
 is
 
a
 
make-up bag
.

It's a beautiful sunny day, and you are going for a walk in the park with your dog, aptly named "Dogbert". You come across a fallen tree blocking the way.

Park


The park is a most excellent place for a walk. At the sound of the word "walk", Dogbert jumps up.




North is the rest of the trail, and south is your house.




There is a large fallen tree blocking the way.




Dogbert is at your heels.




A small picnic table is in the corner of the park. Why anyone would want to eat here is beyond you.

You can't move that tree - it weighs way too much.

I don't suppose 
Dogbert
 would care for that.

=== Zork_LXIX.z5 (v5) ===






You're always kicking yourself that you gave away the Dungeon Master gig all those centuries ago.  That outrageous treasury would come in handy in this nasty economy.  Instead you've piddled your immortal time away in a train of boring menial work, and here you are back in the GUE yet again, carrying that obnoxious brass lantern, on a heroic quest for ... fast food.




It's enough to make you hurl yourself off the parapet at your former workplace.

West Of Chasm


You are standing at the edge of a deep uncrossable chasm
 with no memory whatsoever of how you got here, although the number 68 springs to mind for some reason
.  A not-especially-dark passage leads southwest and a grisly hole in the floor gives you the distinct feeling of being a one-way trip (one of those "you won't be able to get back up" situations).

West Of Chasm


You are standing at the edge of a deep uncrossable chasm
.  A not-especially-dark passage leads southwest and a grisly hole in the floor gives you the distinct feeling of being a one-way trip (one of those "you won't be able to get back up" situations).

Inform port of AAS Masters by James Walmsey


AAS Masters


You have been summoned...called forth -- perhaps in a dream, perhaps in waking life different from the normality you inhabit usually. You are here at the behest of the AAS Masters. And either they will die or you will never ever leave....

Be sure to try smelling in all the rooms!




Blasted Heath


Though you do not know how you came to be on this empty heath, wind whistling around and almost through you, you do know the purpose of your appearance: You must track down and brutally slaughter the AAS Masters! From this heath, all directions are accessible to you.


You can see: 
nothing!

Court Yard


A good sized courtyard with an air of late British colonialism about it.  To the west, in the direction the sun is setting, is a high, grey stone wall with an ornate iron gate set into the rock.  The walls of a large stone mansion rise several stories into the chilly evening air to the east, north, and south.  In the east wall, two or three stories up, is a large window.  On top of the west wall, above and to the right of the gate, is a large squirrels nest made of sticks, twigs, and leaves.

A carpeting of old brown leaves from past winters rustle about on the ground in the breeze and drift listlessly across a cracked, stained, pale green tennis court with a rotting net.  In one corner of the court yard an impressively large oak tree casts long shadows in the dimming light.  The acorns nestled among the tree's massive branches and vividly healthy leaves are new and green.  Near the tree is a quaint looking well of crumbling stone.




A rusty tin pail rests in the grass near the ball machine.




The tennis ball launching machine sitting in one corner of the yard looks like a relic from the 1930s.

You are standing at the end of a road before a small brick building.
Around you is a forest.  A small stream flows out of the building and
down a gully.

Somewhere nearby is Colossal Cave, where others have found fortunes in
treasure and gold, though it is rumored that some who enter are never
seen again.  Magic is said to work in the cave.  I will be your eyes
and hands.  Direct me with commands of 1 or 2 words.

Should you get stuck, type "HELP" for some general hints.  For infor-
mation on how to end your adventure, etc., type "INFO".

I don't know the word "
s
e
l
f
".

> 



I know of places, actions, and things.  Most of my vocabulary
describes places and is used to move you there.  To move, try words
like FOREST, BUILDING, DOWNSTREAM, ENTER, EAST, WEST, NORTH, SOUTH,
UP, or DOWN.  I know about a few special objects, like a black rod
hidden in the cave.  These objects can be manipulated using some of
the action words that I know.  Usually you will need to give both the
object and action words (in either order), but sometimes I can infer
the object from the verb alone.  Some objects also imply verbs; in
particular, "INVENTORY" implies "TAKE INVENTORY", which causes me to
give you a list of the things you're carrying (you can say just
"INV" instead of "INVENTORY" if you wish).  The objects have side
effects; for instance, the rod scares the bird.  Usually people having
trouble moving just need to try a few more words.  Usually people
trying unsuccessfully to manipulate an object are attempting something
beyond their (or my!) capabilities and should try a completely
different tack.  To speed the game you can sometimes move long
distances with a single word.  For example, "BUILDING" usually gets
you to the building from anywhere above ground except when lost in the
forest.  Also, note that cave passages turn a lot, and that leaving a
room to the north does not guarantee entering the next from the south.
Good luck!

With the cantankerous Wizard of Wordplay evicted from his mansion, the worthless plot can now be redeveloped. The city regulations declare, however, that the rip-down job can't proceed until all the items within have been removed.


[ ... ]


That's what the demolition contractor explains to you, anyway, as you stand eagerly on the adventurer's day labor corner. Once he learns of your penchant for puzzle-solving and your kleptomaniacal tendencies, he hires you for the job. You hop into the bed of his truck, type a few Zs, and arrive at the site, eager ...

Foyer


This is the mansion's spacious ground-floor antechamber. The wallpaper is peeling and bits of plaster have fallen from the ceiling here and there. There is a stairway, stable enough to ascend. The big area to the 
west
 must have once been a separate room, but the demolition crew seems to have already taken out a wall. A living room is 
east
. On the 
south
 side is the front door. A Dumpster has been dumped here.


The contractor clears his throat and points at the big Dumpster. "Forget the fixtures, but pick up everything that's not bolted down, including the stuff out back. Then, drop off all the debris - er, I mean, um, treasures - right here ..." He scrawls something on the Dumpster with a marker. "Good luck!" The contractor hurries out the front door, which slams closed, leaving you alone.


You spot a door to the 
north
, leading out back. It is 
shut quite tight.

It's a cold winter day outside, but in the looking-glass house it's summer. All you need to do is pretend there's a way of getting through into it somehow...

Drawing room


The gentle sound of snow against the window pane suggests that it's cold outside, and you're glad to be here in the warmth. The drawing-room is reflected in the large looking-glass on the wall above the mantelpiece, and a very comfortable room it is too, with a warm hearth, a soft rug and an arm-chair that you can curl up and sleep in.




An abandoned chess board lies on the floor.



A discarded ball of worsted lies on the floor here.



Two kittens, one white and one black, are playing together by the arm-chair.

PREFACE

Somewhere in Lancaster County, Pennsylvania, lies a barn, constructed by Amish such as yourself, because everyone needs a barn.

PROLOGUE

You are outside that barn in Lancaster County, Pennsylvania, doing your normal routine, free from the depravity of the Englisch. But your adventurous spirit continues to drive your heart to the dangers and perils that spawn from adventure, and wearing buttons.

INTRODUCTION

In AMISHVILLE, you play the role of a normal Amish householder, living your life in your hometown with your fellow Plain People.



AMISHVILLE

Outside the Barn



ACT I

Lancaster County, Pennsylvania

You are outside your barn, having just parked your buggy inside and stabled the horses. You brush the dust off the brim of your straw hat, loosen two of the hooks of your coat, and stroke your beard thoughtfully. Your adventurous spirit is tugging at you. Perhaps you shouldn't return to your home just yet.

West End


You are at the western end of an impossibly long hallway.  It looks to be about the length of a 100-story building on its side.




A small brass key lies here, smug in its inanimacy.

"I am yours if you prove your love for me." 

"No problem! I'm all over it like a gal dumped the day before Saint Valentine's day. Labors of Hercules? Collect the twelve treasures? What'll it be?" 

"Oh, nothing so difficult as that. I'll be at the exit of this linear maze. The end is only three moves away on a straight line, and then one more move to get out." 

Oh my god a maze. Run screaming! You haven't confronted a maze since the one that killed your parents in Belize... 

But this is Significant Other. For this, for this... no matter what the cost. "What's a linear maze?" 

"It's laid out in a strict, simple, gridlike fashion, and all the routes are reversible." 

"It doesn't sound so bad." 

"Mmhmm. See you soon, my love. Mwa ha ha."

=== asterix.z5 (v5) ===


One more night. One more cold winter night. It's been a painful four weeks but you're SO close you can taste it. And then Mr. Rogers, your Ethics teacher can suck it.

You're going to be a senior and you have BIG plans coming up this summer. Tiffany is going to be life-guarding at the pool and she's promised to get you a cushy job at the snack bar. You'll spend your working days surrounded by cute boy lifeguards and your off-time at the mall.

But then your grades started to slip and, inconceivably, the topic of summer school has come up. To avoid this, you took Ethics 101 this semester, an easy "A". But, in order to pass, you have to perform some sort of volunteer activity for four long painful weeks. The concept of mandatory volunteerism seems odd to you but, nonetheless, here you are, working as a candy striper at St. Asterix Hospital, the oldest and most run-down hospital in the city.

It hasn't been too bad. You mainly do busy work: delivering flowers, passing out magazines, getting patients their slippers or whatnot. Tonight's your last night and your sponsor at the hospital, Mr. Jorry, was going to give you a letter confirming your volunteer hours after you also get the signatures of 8 patients and staff. But, rudely, Mr. Jorry has been found dead in his office. And, even worse, a blizzard blew in tonight and now it doesn't seem like you can even get home.

Mr. Jorry may have been killed and the killer may still be in the building, trapped inside by the storm. But, more importantly, you are NOT going to summer school this year and you'll unmask a murderer if you have to in order to get those signatures and that letter.

Second Floor Elevator Lobby


This is the second-floor elevator lobby. The elevator doors lie to the south, a small panel next to them. The elevator doors are currently 
closed
. A stairwell lies to the north through an open doorway. You see a red sign here that reads "Ward A" above an arrow pointing down the hallway to the west and a blue sign reading "Ward B" above an arrow pointing east. To assist the confused or dense, a red line starts here on the floor and leads west and a similar blue line leads east.

This is a dark stairwell just off the main hallway which lies to the south. A large number "2" is painted on the wall. Concrete stairs zig-zag downward to the floor below.

Grand Exit


The hallway comes to an end here, with a very fancy-looking archway leading out to the south. The rest of this godforsaken place lies beyond a hallway to the north.




A large sign above the door reads "Now Serving #
827
."

=== awaken.z5 (v5) ===


You remember darkness. And the cold. Cold and darkness. And silence. Those memories are all that you have. That, and a feeling that something you never knew you possessed has been lost.

Suddenly, oblivion is split by a blinding light and a crash of sound. You awaken to the roar of a storm and a deluge of rain and mud.

In the Mud


Rain and muddy water are pouring down on you, making it difficult to see or even breathe. Sodden earth and mud surrounds you on all sides except overhead, where flashes of lightning illuminate a storm tossed sky.

In the Mud


Rain and muddy water are pouring down on you, making it difficult to see or even breathe. Sodden earth and mud surrounds you on all sides except overhead, where flashes of lightning illuminate a storm tossed sky.

Your life


A mess of confused emotions and thoughts, with the repugnant odour of unresolved pain seeping out of cracks in the surface. Self-doubt rests heavy in the air.




A man surprises and secretly delights you with his attentions. Does he love you? Do you love him?




An examination looms, causing turbulence.

Dorm A


This is a very long room, lined with multi-tiered bunks. Flimsy partitions between the tiers may provide a modicum of privacy. These spartan living quarters could house hundreds, many of whom are sleeping here right now. There are archways on the north and east walls.

Visible exits: north (to the Long Hall and most of ifMUD), east (to the auditorium), south (to the Edifice Towers)


Wait ...

Something feels different. It's only a vague, almost imperceptible feeling, but the whole atmosphere of the MUD has changed subtly. It seems somehow more serious, more urgent, more real ...

Long Hall


This room is brilliantly lit from all directions. In fact, it is unclear where the walls and ceiling end. A doorway leads to the west, and tunnels lead in most other directions, although all but one are boarded up. An archway stands at the south end of the hall.

Visible exits: south (to Dorm A), west (to the Adventurer's Lounge), southwest (to the Big Dig)

=== azteca.z8 (v8) ===


The initial joy of discovering the first combined shrine and temple of the Aztecs quickly evaporated into abject terror. As the jubilant archeologists and anthropologists and the rare artifacts they had discovered mysteriously started to disappear, dread gripped the excavation party camped just outside the pyramid. The expedition has ground to a halt as you, a world famous adventurer, are summoned to the pyramid to unravel the dark mysteries within. After an unbearably long airplane flight and a five hour bumpy drive from Mexico City, you finally arrive at the expedition camp site.

"Thank heavens!" an uncommonly attractive archeologist exclaims at your arrival. "We've been debating whether or not to quit the camp altogether and return to Mexico City." You have just enough time to drop your duffel bag in a nearby tent before you're fairly dragged over to an incredible causeway built by the Aztecs themselves. "There," your guide says pointing northward. "Just over the causeway and there you are.  Please try not to disturb any of the contents of the pyramid. We've barely started cataloging the contents and have hardly even explored the pyramid itself. The pyramid must be kept in pristine condition or the loss of history could be incalculable." Suddenly, the scientist's voice takes on an edge of stress and starts to talk much faster. "Thanks.  Alot. I'll just be going now." The archeologist fairly jogs southward leaving you to explore the dark pyramid and confront its mysteries yourself.

Causeway


The architectural achievements of the Aztecs are not lost on you as you stand on the beginning of a causeway cutting through the lush jungle foliage and extending out over the water to an ancient stone pyramid temple to the north.

As you were taken from this place to another place, you had the strange and yet disturbing feeling that you were going to fall into a demo. And here you are. And there it is.

The phone booth.

Dammit.

Oh well, let's see what could be done this time to the awful thing. Just don't pick it up, or else you'll die.

The Town Square


You are standing in the middle of a pretty town square in the center of a nondescript New England town. The town seems to be bright and beautiful on this nice sunny day. A circular gravel path cuts through the freshly-mowed grass in the cardinal four directions.




A shiny metal phone booth sits in the center of the square.



Your sword glows with a very bright light!

North of the Town Square


This section of the Town Square contains a small walkway made out of stone, circling around a grassy patch with a large gun in the middle.




A large Howitzer pointing 
north
 is here, mounted on a concrete base.

It's Christmas Eve. Rather late on Christmas Eve.

Just this afternoon your darling 7-year-old daughter Samantha announced that fully a week ago she mailed a letter to Santa Claus asking for Sugar Toes Ballerina, the unbelievably sought-after, impossible-to-find fad doll of the decade. Unwilling to see little Sam heartbroken on Christmas morning, you frantically phoned every toy store in town. Miraculously, you found a shop that claimed to have a Sugar Toes Ballerina in stock!

But that was two hours ago -- before the flat tire. Now it's getting dark, and icy weather is closing in. The address you were given, on the outskirts of town, has proven to be that of a dilapidated and disreputable-looking shopping center -- not a modern chrome-and-neon strip mall, either, but a hulking two-story structure that looks to be the ill-favored offspring of a fairy castle and a canning factory. The shopping center is tucked well back from the street among brooding skeletal trees. Other than a few dim yellowish lights that show no trace of holiday spirit, the building is shrouded in gloom, and yours is the only car in the parking lot.

The Parking Lot


Except for your car and the dirty snowdrifts in the corners, this broad expanse of pavement is entirely empty. The wind whistles a little, and instinctively you hunch your shoulders and turn up your collar. The dark bulk of the shopping center squats in decaying splendor to the south, and a paved walkway leads in that direction.

First, a word of friendly advice. Save your game-in-progress often using the 'save' command. Better still, keep several recent positions stored in different files, so you can get back to any of them if the need arises. Several things that can happen in "Not Just an Ordinary Ballerina" will get you into a situation from which you can't win -- that is, you won't be able to finish the game. With most of these, you'll receive some type of friendly warning, but the warning may not arrive for several turns, so you may not be able to get back to the winning path using the 'undo' command.

If you need help understanding how to move from place to place, type: 'help with moving'. For help handling the objects in the game, type 'help with objects'. For help in structuring your encounters with the people (and other creatures) you may run into from time to time, type 'help with people'.

For general help in understanding what you're trying to accomplish here, type 'help with strategy'. For help with the operation of the software, type 'help with software' or 'help with commands'. For general tips on how to solve the puzzles in the game, type 'help with puzzles'. For a step-by-step walkthrough that explains how to win the game (without giving direct answers to some of the more difficult puzzles) type 'help with walkthrough' or simply 'walkthrough'.


For help with specific puzzles, type 'hint on X' or 'help with X' where 'X' is an object (or a barrier) that you can't figure out how to manipulate successfully so as to get on with your quest. Several hints are provided for each puzzle, with the most oblique hint first and outright instructions last. A couple of puzzles have alternate solutions that are not explained in the hints, but generally you're given some indication that an alternate solution might be available.

Beware: When you ask for a hint on a SPECIFIC puzzle (as opposed to general help on how to cope with the puzzles), the score you earn by solving that particular puzzle will be reduced. Using the walkthrough will also reduce your score. On the other hand, there's a bonus score to be earned by asking for few or no hints. To achieve the highest possible score, avoid asking for hints!



Finally, to learn how "Not Just an Ordinary Ballerina" was created, type 'about' or 'credits'.

You stroll out and stand in the street for a minute. There's not a single car to be seen in either direction. Shortly you give up on this fruitless excursion and wander back into the parking lot.

Sorry, gamers -- for both technical and philosophical reasons, in "Not Just an Ordinary Ballerina" the words 'all' and 'everything' can't be used for picking things up. You can 'drop all' or 'put all in X' if you need to, and you can pick up several items at once by listing them, like this: 'get X and Y and Z'.

What a life.  Grab the french fries.  Put the fries in the basket. Put the basket in the oil.  Wait.  Remove the basket from the oil.  Empty the basket onto the plate.  You look up at the clock.  Ten o'clock -- nearly quitting time.

"All right, let's wrap it up," your boss says.  "Last order.  We need an order of french fries."

Don't panic!  Text adventure games can be pretty daunting to first-time players, but once you master a few common rules, you'll be ready to participate in an interactive story.

COMMANDS

Gameplay is simple.  The computer will tell part of the story, then prompt you to decide what your character will do next.  Most commands are written in simple English sentences.  The computer has a limited vocabulary and an even more limited capacity to understand sentence structure, but most commands will be an imperative sentence in the form:

[ACTION] [NOUN] to/at/with [NOUN]

For example:

TAKE BASEBALL BAT
HIT BALL WITH BAT
DROP BAT


EXPLORATION

Move around the game world by typing the name of a compass direction.  Abbreviations are also accepted:  N, S, W, E, NW, NE, SW, SE.  Up, down, in, and out are also valid directions in certain situations.  "ENTER [NOUN]" sometimes allows you to enter a larger object, and "EXIT" allows you to leave.

The general description of a location is given the first time you enter.  To view your surroundings again, type "LOOK" or just "L".  To inspect a particular item more closely, type "EXAMINE [NOUN]" or just "X [NOUN]".  In some situations, you can "LOOK UNDER [NOUN]" to check underneath it, or "SEARCH [NOUN]" to look inside it.


OBJECTS

Type "TAKE [NOUN]" or "DROP [NOUN]" to pick up or leave behind objects you find along the way.  Some objects are containers; you can "PUT [NOUN] IN [NOUN]" or "REMOVE [NOUN] FROM [NOUN]".  Some objects can be put on top of others; you can "PUT [NOUN] ON [NOUN]".  You can "TRANSFER [NOUN] TO [NOUN]" or "EMPTY [NOUN] ON [NOUN]".  You can check what you're carrying by typing "INVENTORY" or just "I".

CHARACTERS

If you meet any other characters, you can interact with them in a number of ways:

GIVE [NOUN] TO [CHARACTER]
SHOW [NOUN] TO [CHARACTER]
WAKE [CHARACTER]
KISS [CHARACTER]
ATTACK [CHARACTER]

SPECIAL COMMANDS

Type "SAVE" or "RESTORE" for file options.  Type "QUIT" to end or "RESTART" to return to the beginning.  Type "SCORE" to see your score and "FULLSCORE" to see your points broken down by task.


OTHER COMMANDS

If an item has an obvious use, try typing in the command you would expect to use with it.  A few possible commands are listed here:

UNLOCK [NOUN] WITH [NOUN]
LOCK [NOUN] WITH [NOUN]
TURN ON [NOUN]
TURN OFF [NOUN]
OPEN [NOUN]
CLOSE [NOUN]
WEAR [NOUN]
TAKE OFF [NOUN]
EAT [NOUN]
BURN [NOUN]
PRAY
YES
NO
WAKE
LOOK UP [SUBJECT] IN [NOUN] (such as a reference book)
THINK
SMELL [NOUN]
LISTEN
TASTE [NOUN]
TOUCH [NOUN]
DIG
CUT [NOUN]
JUMP
JUMP OVER [NOUN]
CONNECT [NOUN] TO [NOUN]
DISCONNECT [NOUN] FROM [NOUN]
DRINK [NOUN]
FILL [NOUN]
SWIM
SWING [NOUN]
BLOW [NOUN]
RUB [NOUN]
WAVE [NOUN]
PULL [NOUN]
PUSH [NOUN]
READ [NOUN]
SET [NOUN] TO [SETTING]
TAKE A BATH
WAIT

I don't suppose 
your boss
 would care for that.

 Some nights, when people are fast asleep, teddy bears are just waking up.


 And some nights, those teddy bears make mischief.


 And some nights, things somehow turn out for the best...

 (on

Moonlight plays through the window, softly illuminating the bedroom, full of comfortable memories.

To the west is the cupboard where you usually live, and the doorway to the northwest leads to the rest of the house.



David, your owner, lies next to you on the bed, in a deep sleep.


First time players may wish to try HELP.

=== bedlam.z5 (v5) ===


 (type "memo" for author's comments)





  Heads fly and body parts soar through the air as you swing your mighty sword at the horde of evil barbarians. One by one, the minions of the evil overlord Kroz persishes from the wrath of your unforgiving blade. As the last of them collapse in a bloody heap at your feat. You raise your arms and shout out in victory. Princess Zomar rushes up to your side and caresses your bulging pectorals.
  "Thank you, mighty one, for rescuing me from a fate worse than death," she says in a breathy voice.
  "Say no more," you respond. "It was not just my duty. It was my privilege."

  "You are wounded," she gasps as she sees the cuts along your rippling biceps. "I must annoint them with various balms and ointments. I need to gather the magic healing lotion and rub it ever so thoroughly all over your body. But first, I must dress the wounds. Please forgive me, for I have nothing to dress them with apart from my sheer silk nightgown."
  With that, she starts ripping off large shreds of her gown and gingerly wraps them around the wounds, taking time to slide her hands over your body. She leans towards you ear, brushing her large billowy breasts against your shoulder, and whispers, "BEEP BEEP BEEP BEEP"

Your Bedroom
 (
on

bed
)


You blink your eyes as the blaring alarm jars you into waking reality. You come to the sad realization that it was all a dream. The well-endowed Priness Zomar ceases to be and your bulging pecs have been replaced by the reality that is your huge beer gut.


Your bedroom is a nicely orchestrated mess. Clothes and furniture are strewn about in an almost artistic fashion. Salividor Dali would proud, if you had any idea who he was. Right next to the unmade bed is a tiny, wooden dresser. The only exit is to the south.



On 
the 
tiny wooden dresser
 is
 
a
 
alarm clock

You were there for hours, poring over massive volumes, until they sent you out and locked the door. You'd like to continue reading the book you checked out right away but you remember, now, that last night your last light bulb at your home blew, leaving you in the pitch dark. You know they sell light bulbs at the convenience store, downtown. If it's open, you'd also like to stop in at the pet shop--you've always felt a strong connection with animals of all kinds.

The bottom edge of the sun can be seen resting on the horizon.

Library Steps


You are standing in front of a large brick building. The sign over the door reads, STREGOICAVAR PVBLIC LIBRARY. The library is at the north end of a short, dead end street. At the other end it meets a street running east and west. All around you are dark, dilapidated buildings.

About This Game
:

Beneath
 is the first interactive fiction I have written. The storyline is my own but it was inspired by, and contains elements from, several stories by Robert E. Howard; namely, 
Worms of the Earth
, 
The Dark Man
, 
The Lost Race
, and 
The Black Stone
--Robert E. Howard was a writer who wrote numerous short stories, in a wide range of genres. He is best known as the creator of Conan. None of the stories just listed, however, are Conan stories.


Changes from version 1
:
For the second release of 
Beneath
 I have added more clues to many of the puzzles, given the player more direction and motive toward completing the objectives and clues to knowing what the objectives are, corrected a few errors in implementation (one of my favorite bits of text, which appears when you first enter the pit, didn't appear in the first release because of an error in implementation), and made many other improvments.


Instructions
:
This game is played mainly like most other IF. If you've never played IF before, the basic idea is that you type commands to solve puzzles and/or advance the storyline. For each turn, decide what you want to do and phrase it in a simple way, usually beginning with a verb. The best way to learn how to play IF is by trying it. Read each new text carefully. Examine everything. There are often subtle clues. Ask the people (or other intelligent beings) you meet about things you think they might know about. Below is a list of 
some
 of the commands that 
may
 be useful in 
Beneath
.

go in direction: NORTH, SOUTH, SOUTHEAST, UP, DOWN, etc.
INVENTORY
TELL (animate being) ABOUT/TO (topic)
ASK (animate being) ABOUT/FOR (topic)
LOOK
LOOK AT/EXAMINE/LOOK IN/LOOK ON/LOOK UNDER (object or animate being)
WAIT
LISTEN TO (object or animate being)
TOUCH (object or animate being)
ATTACK (object or animate being) WITH (object)
THROW (object) AT (object or animate being)
GIVE (object) TO (animate being)
TAKE/DROP (object)
PUSH/PULL (object)
PUT (object) IN/ON (object)
OPEN/CLOSE (object)
WEAR/REMOVE (object)
SIT IN/SIT ON/ENTER (object)
STAND/EXIT
repeat last action: AGAIN
undo last turn (can't undo successive turns): UNDO

Some commands can be abbreviated. For directions the first letters can be used: N, S, SE, U, D, etc. LOOk can be abbreviated L, you can EXAMINE by using X, and Z can be used instead of WAIT.


Beneath
 starts in VERBOSE mode, which means a description of your location will be printed every time you move to a different location. BRIEF mode will print a description of your location only if you haven't been there before. SUPERBRIEF mode will never print a description of your location until you LOOK. Type VERBOSE, BRIEF, or SUPERBRIEF to switch to the corresponding mode.

If, at any time, you would like to view the walkthrough, type WALKTHRU.

It is possible, and even probable, that at some point you will put the game into an unwinnable state; so, there may be times when you will want to restart or restore, and then try doing things differently, or in a different order. Keep an eye out for signs, or clues, that hint that the game has become unwinnable.


Notes About Interpreters
:
Though it's of minor importance, it is preferable with 
Beneath
, if you have the choice, to use an interpreter that displays italics rather than underlining. If your interpreter uses italics the title in this paragraph should be italicized.

The tree and house on the title page will not display correctly on some interpreters.


Credits
:
Graham Nelson for Inform, Daniel Barkalow for Scoper.h, Jesse Burneko for Info.h, Neil Brown and Alan Trewartha for Moveclass.h, Jim Fisher for orcenter.h.

Once again, you wake up in the same old bed with the same old sun glaring through your window. And once again the sheets are bunched around your huge erection. You know, it's really time you did something about that.





Your Modest Abode


A simple room, for a man not overly concerned with the materials of life: There's but a simple bed (unmade) and dresser (beat-up). You're really a people person: especially female people with big tits who suck a lot of dick. Speaking of which, let's get to work.
The hallway is south.

"Hello, kiddies, welcome to the first ADDition of TALES FROM THE COLLEGE. I'm your host Mr. Worse, Dean of PERMANENT student residence. Since this is my FIRST-YEAR show, I wanted to show you a DOUBLE ROOM but I had trouble selecting a roommate. I couldn't DIFFERENTIATE between them. So, tonight I've decided to introduce you to Kevin Johnson. But unfortunately he's been experiencing a BINARY BREAKDOWN. Perhaps, you can ADVISE him or maybe all he needs is...A BREATH OF FRESH BLAIR!"

*SNAP* That was the sound of your last nerve cracking. You've lived here in Blair Hall too long. The neglectful RA, the screams at night, the fights in the halls and the vomit in the bathroom. You've tolerated it all until now. But now the sight of the broken dryer has caused the very last ounce of tolerance you had to come smashing down. You mind has performed a complete register dump of it's ability to think rationally. You are experiencing a BINARY BREAKDOWN!

Laundry Room


This room is supposed to be the laundry room. If not for the word of your RA you would easily have believed that this was the junkyard. The hallway is to the east.



A broken dryer slouches in one corner.



The companion machine, a washer, sits beside it.

"Twenty-three dollars," he's saying. "Twenty-three dollars for the best dream of your life."

You don't know his name or anything -- he's just the guy you always meet at parties thrown by people you've never met. He's nobody's friend, exactly, but everyone knows who he is when it's time. Probably doesn't even have a name, probably has bagged groceries at some godforsaken Shopper's Food Warehouse since high school, but who cares? He's here to help you in your hour of need.

"What do you say?" he asks, holding up a repurposed cough syrup bottle with something green inside. Green like candy almost never is.



Stuck in an Attic


Sure, you're used to piece-of-shit architecture (you live in Dundalk, for crissake), but this place will be receiving some kind of award from you by the end of the night. There's totally unimportant crap strewn all over the place -- old sewing machines, an Easy-Bake oven, even a set of folding chairs painted carnival blue -- but fortunately, almost all of it is in shadow thanks to an underperforming fifty-watt bulb directly above.

It's just you and the dude here. The only place in the entire house you could get any privacy. It's only ten o'clock and already the call to hook up has come down from the heavens.

Stairs lead downward, back to the party and that awful trance-bop they keep playing.

You're Dante Hicks. No, not the main character from 
Clerks
. You're at least ten times too smart to be working a convenience store. Instead you're maxing it as a sysadmin for this local real-estate company. This will probably be important to remember at some point in the future, but until then:


You're in full party dress uniform: black jeans and neo-geek T-shirt (tonight, "THERE'S NO PLACE LIKE 127.0.0.1") which is admittedly Not Cool At All, but you've always held out hope that the shirt will someday flag down some amazingly hot chick who also happens to be a closet Unix freak. It could happen. Until then, it at least confuses people into thinking you might be cool.

Stuck in an Attic


Sure, you're used to piece-of-shit architecture (you live in Dundalk, for crissake), but this place will be receiving some kind of award from you by the end of the night. There's totally unimportant crap strewn all over the place -- old sewing machines, an Easy-Bake oven, even a set of folding chairs painted carnival blue -- but fortunately, almost all of it is in shadow thanks to an underperforming fifty-watt bulb directly above.

It's just you and the dude here. The only place in the entire house you could get any privacy. It's only ten o'clock and already the call to hook up has come down from the heavens.

Stairs lead downward, back to the party and that awful trance-bop they keep playing.

As the security guard waves you through, you linger for a moment to absorb the historic nostalgia of your surroundings... 

Paramount Studios. 

You can almost feel the ghosts of Gary Cooper and Cecil B. Demille brush past as you clutch your knapsack close to your heart. Inside the tattered little sack is the culmination of two years work: a seven part mini-series you've written on the life of former vice-President Walter Mondale, entitled 
Fritz, We Hardly Knew Ye.
 Beaming with pride since the completion of your epic, you've had your sales pitch memorized and well-honed for weeks now; certain of success once you finagled an appointment with that legendary television producer, Irving M. Sowritch. A quick glance at your appointment slip affirms your timing is perfect. In a few minutes you'll have him eating out of your hand.

An avid devotee of film history, you've read a great deal about this grand old piece of real estate. You feel as if you know it well. Looking around, you begin to imagine which of these historical offices you'll soon be calling your own. But you quickly shake off the seductive daydream, intent on remembering the security guard's directions: northeast to the Administration building, then straight ahead until you're outside Sowritch's office.



Melrose Gate


This is the grand entrance to the studio lot. For almost a hundred years the famous arches to the south have been the portal beneath which Hollywood's greatest stars have passed on their way to silver screen immortality. A pleasant walkway heads west, while the studio's main administration building can be seen off to the northeast.

You look like a confident, self-assured writer, bubbling with excitement at the prospect of finally reaching your appointment with destiny. You're having a good hair day as well, thank God.

This version of 
Tinseltown Blues
 does not have a detailed hint system in place (although one is planned and will probably find its way into later versions). Patience and exploration will, however, lead to some hints being... err... delivered over the course of play.

Bug reports/comments/suggestions may be e-mailed to the author at 
tinseltownblues@aol.com

=== bofh.z5 (v5) ===


It's a clear summer night in London.  You walk purposefully down Langley Street in Covent Garden looking for the pub.  It's nearly time and you can't be late.  Tonight is the most important night of your life.  Ah! Here's the pub! You enter and walk directly to the bar, weaving in and around throngs of patrons happy to be enjoying a drink after a day's work.  You approach the bartender and inquire. You were told to speak to Nigel.  The bartender confirms he is Nigel and he asks your business.  You give him the reply just as you were told.  He nods his head solemnly and asks you to follow him.


He leads you to a door towards the back of the bustling pub. He gives the door two sharp knocks, pauses for three seconds then two more sharp knocks.  A regal voice from behind the door simply says "Enter!".  With that, Nigel hurriedly backs away and turns tail to resume simpler, safer duties tending bar.  You enter the room dutifully and close the door behind you.  Looking around you are deeply impressed with the furnishings.  Lots of red cloth, leather couches and recliners, the heavy smoke of cigars and the presence of just three men.  You know you are in the presence of true masters of their craft.  One of the men you recognize as your mentor, Simon.  The other two gentlemen you haven't met before.


The youngest man, perhaps 25 years old at best, rises and looks you over.  "I am the Grand Bastard." He has an unmistakable British accent. "Who sponsors this apprentice bastard?", indicating you. Your mentor rises and claims responsbility for the sponsorship. "Very well, let the trials begin.  I shall go first."

"An utterly clueless network user calls and asks you why the network is running so slow.  What is your response?"

"I cheerfully volunteer to immediately inspect the co-worker's computer, diagnose the problem and repair it." With this, you can see the Grand Bastard is greatly offended.  Undaunted, you continue..." I get under their desk, open the computer case and swap out the 100 megabit network card and replace it with a 300 baud modem with the speaker disabled.  I close the computer cover, plug the modem into a phone line, boot up the computer and make lightning-fast configuration changes the user can't follow.  When I'm all done their 100 megabit per second connection is reduced to a 300 bit per second connection via demand-dial connectivity.  Without a doubt, they will never call me and complain again."

You wait breathlessly for the reaction of The Grand Bastard.  "That is an excellent solution.  You have passed my trial." Looking around at his two peers he continues, "Indeed, your response is so thorough, so diabolical and so effective I think we can dispense with the remaining trials.  Are we agreed?" Your mentor and the other BOFH both nod their assent.


"Then it is done.  I confer upon thee the formal title of Bastard Operator from Hell.  Return to the United States of America and do us proud.  Now.  Go! Begin thy tenure!"

Mission Control


Your office, where you carry out your Bastardly duties, is equipped with the finest furnishings and equipment necessary to perform your work.  As you have an aversion to cheap kit, your desk is the finest example of office furniture ever bestowed upon the human race.  Sitting atop this monument to furniture is the single most powerful computer in the company; your personal workstation.  Only two decorations adorn the walls; a Bill Gatus of Borg poster and a daily calendar.  North leads out of Mission Control to other, less important areas while you spot a very large and serious looking door down the hall just east.



On 
the 
desk
 are
 
an 
inbox
 (in 
which 
is 
a 
note from your boss
)
 and 
an 
outbox
 (which 
is
 empty)
.



You

 and 
Dave's Toshiba laptop

The Town Square


You are standing in the middle of a pretty town square in the center of a nondescript New England town.  Like most any other nondescript New England towns, there's not much to see or do here, but maybe you'll find something amusing and enjoyable to do.




A shiny metal phone booth sits in the center of the square.

(
the 
phone booth
)

You grunt with all your might and heave the phone booth onto your shoulders.  For a moment or two it looks as if you're not going to be able to lift it, but heroically you finally lift it high in the air!  Seconds later, however, you topple underneath the weight, and the booth crushes you fatally.  Geez!  Didn't I tell you not to pick up the phone booth?!  Isn't the name of this very game "Pick Up The Phone Booth and Die"?!  Man, you're dense.  No big loss to humanity, I tell ya.




    
***
 You have died 
***




In that game you scored 
0
 out of a possible 
100
, in 
3
 turn
s
, giving you the rank of 
total and utter loser, squished to death by a damn phone booth.



Would you like to RESTART, RESTORE a saved game
, give the FULL score for that game
 or QUIT?

=== brainofthenightguest.z8 (v8) ===






After dreams of swedish fish fountains and 5-cent space otter rides, you find yourself unwillingly dragged back into consciousness. You open your eyes slowly to the sight of a completely bare ceiling. Your thoughts swim aimlessly in your head, trying to figure out what was happening before you passed out.




"Hi there!" a chipper voice says. You raise your head and see the flashing light-eyes of a maintenance bot. "Seems like you were unconscious in the bathroom! I moved you here."




Oh yeah. You had been on a field trip with your class to the Plutonian Commonwealth museum, learning about ancient technology and the history of the braintree and lots of educational stuff. As always, you find things way more educational when combined with the results of your pharmaceutical class, so you got totally fruitbat flapjacks on yesterday's lesson. You guess it must have been too much for you and you passed out.




"Sorry, but the museum's already closed and your tour group has gone. Since you're not supposed to be here, we'll have to have the security guy take you to the police in the morning. In the meantime, I'm off duty, so -" the light-eyes of the maintenance bot die out as it goes into sleep mode.




Dang. You've taken so many liberties in pharmaceutical class, you'd have a ton of paperwork to do if the police end up taking you out of here. You're going to have to find an exit on your own.

Maintenance Room


You are in a sparse, small room with no decoration whatsoever. It stinks of garbage, metal and oil.  From here, you can go north into the main museum hall, west into a nasty little break room, and east down a smelly hallway.




A pile of fat black garbage bags take up most of the room.




Nearby, a maintenance bot squats, inactive and shut off.

Maintenance Room

Plutonian Commonwealth Museum, Grand Hall


Of all of the halls, this is the grandest. It even has a sweeping staircase going up to a balcony type thing that overlooks where you're standing. This room was created exclusively to house the magnificent braintree, which is in the center of the room. The maintenance room
 where you woke up
 is to the south, and an unobtrusive door with an excessively obtrusive padlock on it is to the east.




There's a placard above the padlocked door to the east.




You 
can 
also 
see 
a 
planter
 (in 
which 
is 
a 
magnificent braintree
)
, 
a 
brain tank
 (empty)
, 
a 
transfer chair
, 
a

, 
a 
display note
 and 
a 
warning sign

Business of late has been slow. But then, its been like that since the Cold War ended. Or rather, since it actually ended, last year. And where does that leave you? There's no way you'll turn to stealing car radios and the like, that's for criminals with no sense of scale. This is really just an extension of what you did in MI7 all those years ago. Except now everyone comes to you, from all over the world. The only real worry is that of accidentally starting a war... 

But now, all you've got to do is wait for Victor, your "secretary" to come in with an assignment.

Your Office

Your office is simplistic enough, you don't need much. In fact, the only vital piece of equipment here is the door so you can get out, which is to the east.




Your handy black rucksack is in a heap on the floor.




Your desk fills nearly half the room.

This is the job that all men in white coats dream of...a potential epidemic. The details were sparse but menacing - mysterious, unexplained deaths in the isolated Dales village of Skebdale. The authorities had no choice but to send you, their most experienced environmental health agent, to check things out. Unfortunately it looks more like a job for Bond than for Herriot...

Country Lane


A winding country road threads its way between old stone cottages and barns. Daffodils and snowdrops spring from the grass verges, adding a dash of colour to the grey walls and roofs. To your north, the sign of 'The Green Calf' 
swings in the sunshine,
 beckoning locals and tourists alike to pop in for a drink. There is a small garden to the south of the road which is attached, unsurprisingly, to a small house.




A short gravel track leads up to a wooden gate to your north-east.




Your car, a battered blue Volvo estate, is slewed across the grass verge, two wheels in the ditch.

=== building.z5 (v5) ===



You are wearing a leaden overcoat stumbling down a hallway filled with strobe lights. Anxiety runs like an electric wire through your frame as you can feel the eyes upon you; eyes, forever-staring; eyes boring holes through your back; eyes peering out from translucent drawer-like plates in the hall. You hold your breath hoping somehow to black out, but the floor melts and the scene shifts. 

You are running down an endless plain on a moonless night, where the stars sit in judgement like needles waiting to fall upon you. It rains clocks and they pelt you as you run, dodging shattered stopwatches and blaring alarm clocks. The scene shifts again. 

Every action seems in slow-motion as though you were moving through time. You raise your head to look in the mirror and see yourself growing older, a year for every moment. You turn away and look back to see a skeleton staring back at you, its jaws gibbering madly. 

Then you are sleeping. A gentle touch upon your shoulder and you awake, blinking into focus a strange and yet uncannily familiar world. The abandoned parking lot and the broken streets keen with secrets just out of reach. Before you is the building. It lurks like a coiled dragon, a summation of fear and deadly challenge, of past and of present. You hear a final distant voice that seems a greeting as well as benediction, "This is the dark night of the soul."


Building

The building lurking before you, an endless night.

Before the Building


The building rises before you, a hulking shadow, blocking out the stars above and disfiguring the moon. Windows upon windows pit its smooth obsidian surface, glinting like tiny gasoline-colored eyes. A garrulous display of floodlights spray up from the ground floor like failed fireworks, casting writhing shadows from the dense bushes that ring the building except where the sidewalk splits them asunder. The slate sidewalk continues from the building, between the hedges to end at your feet, eroded smooth.

Before the Building


The building rises before you, a hulking shadow, blocking out the stars above and disfiguring the moon. Windows upon windows pit its smooth obsidian surface, glinting like tiny gasoline-colored eyes. A garrulous display of floodlights spray up from the ground floor like failed fireworks, casting writhing shadows from the dense bushes that ring the building except where the sidewalk splits them asunder. The slate sidewalk continues from the building, between the hedges to end at your feet, eroded smooth.

=== bunny.z5 (v5) ===




  The voice still echoes in your head. "Remember--if the bunny is not dead by midnight, the countryside will be ruled by evil." 

  You shiver as you think of the people dead in the street with bite marks on their neck. The cattle dead by the hundreds. The stories of a rampaging vampire bunny. A chill runs up your spine. 

  And lastly, you remember the strangeness of the graveyard the last time you saw it. The misty fog surrounding it. And now you're in the graveyard, alone, armed only with your apple and your trusty quill pen.

Carrot Field


You are in a carrot field in the middle of a graveyard. Fog is all around you. A wall is to the north, too high to climb.

Carrot Field


You are in a carrot field in the middle of a graveyard. Fog is all around you. A wall is to the north, too high to climb.

=== burglar.z5 (v5) ===





You are a master thief and you've just broken into one of many properties owned by Jefferson Smith, the fifteenth wealthiest person in England. All you have to do is load up your swag bag with valuables and get to your getaway car. Should be simple...

As planned, the cleaning lady accepted a small bribe and left the front door ajar. Without any difficulty you've been able to slip into the hallway unnoticed...

Hall


This vast hall is obviously intended to impress visitors. A large grandfather clock stands on one side with an impressive flight of stairs on the other.
 A long dirty coat is hanging on a hook by the front door.
 Rooms lead off to the east and the south. The front door is to the north.

HELP!

The aim of the game is to strip the house of all its valuables, putting them in your swag bag and then make your getaway.

Street


You're standing outside 11 Morrison Drive, an impressive and well kept Georgian townhouse in the leafy suburbs of Surrey. A paved drive provides enough room to park a couple of cars.




A dark blue Ford Mondeo is carefully parked on the road, just far enough away to be inconspicuous and close enough in case you need to make a quick getaway.

McDonald's Hamburger Restaurant, Miami Beach, Florida


McDonald's Hamburger Restaurant, Miami Beach, Florida
 (on 
your seat
)


Not exactly the holiday of a lifetime. You've come here to investigate the mysterious disappearance of several UFOs in the Bermuda Triangle (which, as you've discovered, is not a triangle but a trapezium, stretching as far back as New Mexico), but the authorities have been doing everything they can to block you. The girl in the City Hall even pretended not to know what you were talking about! If you were the paranoid type, you'd suspect the aliens themselves were in on the conspiracy, but no, it's probably just the usual government cover-up.

All the same, it's best to lie low for a while. To avoid suspicion (not to mention the mosquitoes) you've camped down for the afternoon in this innocuous family restaurant, drinking coffee. And what better way to pass the time than play an Infocom game on your PalmPilot? You can't beat the old-school games, and in Infidel's case, you literally can't beat it. In fact, you've been stuck in the slab room for sixteen years. Sixteen years -- now that's entertainment.

Truth be told, though, that puzzle is starting to irritate you now. As is the foul-smelling vagrant who has seated himself at the table opposite you. To see such people in McDonald's of all restaurants! Standards really have fallen, and not just in the IF community.

The man, the name, the legend. By night, you're a freelance programmer, one of the best in the business. By day, you're an original thinker, independent intellectual, and fearless crusader for Truth. You've had your run-ins with the government, but in spite of everything, you're still as good-looking as ever.



The vagrant seems strangely interested in your PalmPilot.

The vagrant keeps looking at your PalmPilot. Knowing his type, he probably wants to steal it. But you're ready for him. Just let him try.

Top of the lighthouse


You are standing at the top of a lighthouse, with glass panels all around the circular room. It is pitch black outside and rain pounds the glass. The occasional lightning strike lights up the night sky giving you a brief glimpse of a lifeless horizon and a dark, empty sea. Steps lead downwards into the lighthouse.




The main lighthouse lamp stands impressively in the centre of the room.

Foyer


Your not quite sure what a foyer is, but you are most certain you are in one. Auntie has told you enough times. It's a pleasant enough room, with a carpet like a shaggy dog and nice wallpaper showing pictures of little fairies playing. To the south is the door to outside. There are also stairs leading up and exits to the east and west.

You control your actions using simple two (or less) word commands.


Movement is performed by using the initial letter of the compass points (n, s, w, e) and up and down (u, d).


Some of the possible commands:


    look (or "l") - restates your position


    get object - pick an object up


    drop object - put an object down


    examine (or "x") object - take a closer look, and maybe even get a clue


    inv (or "i") - display an inventory of your current possessions


    use object - do some action with an object (only works in certain places)


    help - displays this screen


    save - save the game


    restore - restore a previously saved game


    restart - restart the game


    moves - display number of moves taken


    wait - do nothing for a turn


    quit (or "q") -  exit the game




Other things to try:


    open object (with object)


    put object in object


    unlock object with object


    eat object


    jump object


    pull object


    push object


    throw object direction


    switch on object

Dreaming
 (in 
the 
armchair
)


The room is small and richly carpeted. Or maybe it's a tent. There's a hint of curtains or tapestries in the darkness beyond the little pool of light in the centre.




In the center of the room is a simple steel-and-glass table with a chessboard on it.



On 
the 
glass table
 are
 
a 
chessboard
 and 
a 
glass orb
.

=== catseye.z3 (v3) ===
Saying your uncle Xevion is odd is an understatement. He is also absent-minded.
But when uncle Xevion asked you to run back to his house to retrieve his
favorite necklace, you jumped at the chance. His house is never dull. When
you go to pick up the necklace from the mantle, it falls off into the fireplace.

Silence.
Autumn 2097. People have been taking to the hills. Hiding. Now people are running, other people standing. A light in the sky unchanging.
 You wont find him of course. You never do.

You are standing on a steep sided hill. Behind you to the east is a range of mountains trapping the city against the sea. In front of you would once have been a forested plain stretching down to the sparkling sea. You can imagine the first humans to see this place, standing on the hilltop, the ancestors of this great city in front. You feel a sense of kinship with that ancient people, as you stand knowing that you will be the last person to see this now metropolised, cultivated plain.




Hilltop


You look across a city to the sea on the far side. A silent city. The hilltop itself is barren of trees, although the steep slopes around are wooded. You must be standing a good forty or fifty metres above the city below.




A dull star stands out against the cloudless twilight sky. It will soon hit the earth four hundred miles away.




People stand around you.

This game is not quite complete. The storyline is, but alot of the text needs to be polished up. This game is not very challenging. I do not think you need help. Game design and execution and artwork by Hugo Martay. Contact me at hugo.martay@magd.ox.ac.uk. The only puzzle in the game is that of how to make a plutonium bomb. Work it out for yourself. There are two possible endings.



The star continues its slow move west.

You look along the coast to the north. You do not have time to explore this. The city can be reached by climbing down off the hill/



The star brightens until it is dazzlingly. It now swings west and disappears over the horizon.

Welcome to the Kingdom of Zork!

You are bored. There's nothing on TV except some stupid reruns.

You wander into your local book store and pick up an interesting-looking book entitled Zork: The Cavern of Doom. As usual, you turn to the first page and begin reading.

The book is set in the magical land of Zork, where a new, incredibly rich underground realm has just been discovered. Dozens of adventurers have entered The Cavern of Doom, but none have returned. Only YOU can save them! There are bad-tempered warlocks, huge diamonds, dragons, and a giant empire to explore.

It looks like this book is good!

What do you want to do?
[1] Do you choose to save the kingdom? If so, read on!
[2] Or do you choose to go home and watch reruns?

=== cavetrip.z5 (v5) ===




You've been excited about THIS trip for more than a month! Your troop is going on a caving expedition to Cumberland Caverns! You've just finished your homework for the weekend, and are all ready to pack for the trip. Being a newbie to the caving scene, you are glad that the troop provided a packing list for you. However, during the week you lost the list somewhere. So you'll either have to find the list or pack what you can remember from memory. 


Your mom comes into your bedroom and reminds you that you only have an hour before you have to leave, so you'd better pack quickly.

So, you want a little help, huh? 
Well, here's a little help.
To go from place to place, you type the direction. 
(North, South, Up, Down, In, Out)
You can shorten this usually to just the first letter. 

Here is a partial list of commands you can give me: 
To See Directions and a Description of the Room, Type LOOK or L 
Directions: N,S,E,W,In,Out,U,D 
Drink, Eat, Use, Light, Wear, Search, Look 
To see what you are carrying, type I or Inventory 
To examine something, type X or Examine 
To search something for hidden items, type Search 
To wait a while type Wait or Z (You may very well type this a LOT!)
To see your Score type Score 

You can ask someone about something by typing 'Ask Mom about xxxxxx' 
Sometimes, to get something to happen, you might have to GIVE the object to another character, like your Mom, or your buddy Ryan. 
If you play this game on your home computer rather than through the Java version (on a webpage) you can SAVE or RESTORE a game. 
To Quit, type Q or Quit
 
To GET MORE SPECIFIC HELP, Type 'HINT'

=== cheater.z5 (v5) ===





Note:  Before playing this game, you should type in the command "info" for an introduction.  If you get stuck, a hint is provided by the command "arrrgh".  That's three r's.  Thank you.


    It is the year 2753.  You are engaged in a contest, a race across the galaxy to acquire the Toaster of Battle Creek Michigan (the last functioning toaster in the known universe, and therefore extremely valuable.)

    You like to win.  To ensure your success in this competition, you sabotaged the starships of the other participants.  Now you alone (or at least you and your faithful assistant Walter) have discovered the cavern of the Toaster.  Gloatingly, you ordered Walter to lower you into the cave...

    But your rope snapped, and now you're trapped here - perhaps forever...

Treasure Chamber


This is one of the largest caverns you have ever been in.  The ceiling is forty feet up, and the walls are quite a ways away.  The ceiling is supported by massive pillars formed from stalactites and stalagmites.  The phosphorescent moss that lines the walls provides a dim glow.  Mysterious carvings have been left on one wall.  There is an opening to the east.

    In the center of the cave stands the object of your quest:  The massive, thirty-foot pedestal on which the legendary Toaster of Battle Creek has stood for centuries.



On 
the 
massive pedestal
 is
 
the
 
Toaster of Battle Creek
.



You
 can 
see 
a
 
rocket pack
 and 
a
 
coyote skeleton
 here.

   You, Mr. Mousebender, are an English gentleman, in search of cheesy comestibles. In other words, you wish to buy some cheese.

CHEESESHOP is, of course, based on the famous Cheeseshop sketch by Monty Python's Flying Circus, and its original text may be found in 
Monty Python's Flying Circus: Just the Words Volume Two.
 But what you may not know is that I first wrote this interactive version of Cheeseshop in JotaCode for the ifMud, and the source code for that version may be found at http://webhome.idirect.com/~dswxyz/cheeseshop.html .

In case you're not familiar with the sketch, you are playing the role of Mousebender, who attempts to buy many varieties of cheese from Wensleydale, the shopkeeper. To do this, type commands like ASK MAN ABOUT BRIE or BUY GOUDA. Only varieties of cheese are recognized; the game doesn't know about brand names like Kraft or Velveeta. If you can't think of a new variety of cheese, type THINK.

If you are familiar with the sketch, be assured that this is an 
interactive
 variant, which means that you can try to ask for different varieties of cheeses in any order (not just in the same order as in the original sketch), and do a few other things besides. On the other hand, the game remains somewhat "on the rails" in other ways, mostly so that progress through the dialogue occurs in reasonable order. (For example, the game will dissuade you from buying cheddar until late in the game.) 

It's just a short little game, but I do hope you have fun with it. And thanks to folks on the ifMud for help and beta-testing, you know who you are.

=== cheshire-cat.z5 (v5) ===




This year too you decided to go for a walk to the book fair that takes place in the old town centre. After visiting the stand of the "Ludo Ergo Sum" club run by your friends Mario e Luigi, on the right side of the main street, you headed to Miky Bar to drink a beer to their health.

You're still having your drink when Mario bursts into the bar and says that the Cheshire Cat is missing! It is an unruly feline that meows all the time and pees and poos everywhere. But it is also the mascot of the club: without it your friends can't organize any other event, so it's a matter of life and death to find it as soon as possible.

Before letting you to your mission, Mario reminds you the rules to play a text adventure:

  - Every command has to be inserted with the syntax verb + noun: >get beer, >open door, >examine jacket, >wear hat, >ask girl about cat, >hit vandal...

  - To move from one place to another within the game world, you have to use the directions >north (or just n), >south (s), >east (e), >west (w), >up (u), >down (d).

  - The command >inventory (i) prints the list of the objects you have, while >look (l) shows the description of the place where you currently are.

  - The verbs you can use in this game are: get, examine, show and give [something to someone], ask and tell [someone about something], answer [something to someone], wait, sing, sleep, jump, listen, wear, remove, open, close, unlock, lock, hit, empty [something on something else], eat, drink, play, burn.

  - Examining the furnitures and the details mentioned in the descriptions of the places allows you to find hidden objects and important information. By speaking with the other characters you can know what you have to do to obtain their help.

  - To read again these instructions and information about the author and the software license type >info or >instructions.

Have fun!

Miky Bar


You are at Miky Bar, a famous hangout in the old town centre, where every reason is good for eating tons of snacks and belting down any kind of booze. To the east you can reach the main street.




On the table in front of you, there is your bottle of beer.



Mario is here.

Waiting Area


Apparently a few others were desperate too.  An interesting mix of people are sitting here while a strange rendition of "Rock The Casbah" plays in the background.

-- The number [1] television executive (for the 12th rated network)
-- A curator for the [2]nd most recognized museum in the world
-- The [3]rd least talented actress in Hollywood
-- [4]get the rest, babe, a successful talent agent

Whatever the reasons, you're all here in this front room of an inner city row house.  While half expecting to get mugged any second in some elaborate gang set up, you hear a refined, feminine voice interrupt the music through the intercom, "Who's next, please?"  [1-4]

It's Thursday night and you're at Mick's Unwashed Outback Tavern. All the girls you couldn't nail while wasting away at military school are out looking to meet interesting chaps like yourself and your compatriots. The 'Mick is kind of a meat-market (meaning that predators of both gender and varying sexual preference skulk about attempting to discern potential companionship for an evening... and the prey have no illusions about that). Your friends and co-workers Keegan and Pang have joined you. They're great guys to go bar-hopping with: Pang left to use the lavatory an eternity ago while Keegan just bolted to hit on a girl. They do, however, always have your back and allow you to be a complete assjack when you party together. You definitely lucked out in getting to know them as most of the people you meet at work are a bunch of stiffs. Tonight there really does seem to be an inordinate amount of sexy knock-outs to chat up. Pump it up, Avandre, and try not to bring your boys down!

Bar


You are up against the bar of Mick's Unwashed Outback Tavern and have a pretty solid view of the kids whom have come out tonight to party. Preps, goths, betties, freaks, cheerleaders, milfs, sorority types -- you've never seen the place so packed with such wholesome goodness. Fortunately it appears as if your competition contains an inordinate amount of chuds and losers.

Keegan returns, shaking his head. He briefly looks toward you. "God, she smelled like an absolute honeypot. And I don't mean that in a sexist way, I mean it literally. Like she had bathed in honeycomb or something." He takes a sip and continues. "I mean, I can deal with that, you  know? I told her I was having difficulty mating my plastic honey bear because the only other syrup-based lifeform I knew was Aunt Jemima and it didn't want to go hogging. I was about to ask her if she wanted to help out when she copped this major 'tude. Apparently she was totally unaware what she smells like. Pfft. Clueless."

You nod. "Dude, no worries there. I'm guessing it would have ended badly when she got attacked by a swarm of yellowjackets right before you were about to drop the hammer."

Keegan grins at that, his morale restored. "Er, well, I also accidentally sneezed all over her. That probably had something to do with her rapid case of frostbite."

(Avandre Varick)
You are a fine specimen of humanity. You have brown eyes and black hair (which is currently styled as a random smattering of dreadlocks). You are wearing a black-and-red football jersey, a pair of cargo pants and a pair of hightops minus the laces. You are generally regarded by many as a complete assjack.

Keegan
: 
That on the 1st day of January, A.D. 1863, all persons held as slaves within any State or designated part of a State the people whereof shall then be in rebellion against the United States shall be then, thenceforward, and forever free; and the executive government of the United States, including the military and naval authority thereof, will recognize and maintain the freedom of such persons and will do no act or acts to repress such persons, or any of them, in any efforts they may make for their actual freedom.

That the executive will on the 1st day of January aforesaid, by proclamation, designate the States and parts of States, if any, in which the people thereof, respectively, shall then be in rebellion against the United States; and the fact that any State or the people thereof shall on that day be in good faith represented in the Congress of the United States by members chosen thereto at elections wherein a majority of the qualified voters of such States shall have participated shall, in the absence of strong countervailing testimony, be deemed conclusive evidence that such State and the people thereof are not then in rebellion against the United States.
Keegan looks at you strangely.

If it's not an adage, it ought to be: a lord asks no favor from a peasant. Yet there he was, in your own family's modest home, waving what used to be his hand in the air and looking at you with eyes full of supplication.


"You have proven yourself to be the ablest, cleverest, and wisest youth in the province, and it is to you we must turn to save us from this affliction, " insisted Lord Midel. He gestured with his transformed hand, which had become the paw of a lion, at the similarly changed appendages of your family members. Following the arc of his paw, you ended up looking down at your father's feet, changed into oxen hooves by the cruelty the wizard Marnian had inflicted on your poor province and everyone in it.


Your mother's dove wing fluttered anxiously as she looked at you through pained eyes, and said, "I fear for you, dear one, but perhaps you can find on your quest some means of restoring prosperity to our village, which has been too long poor." You gazed for the hundredth time at the too-worn, too-old cottage, at your transformed brother and sister, and at your own left hand, now the paw of a wolf, and finally turned to your lord, saying "There seems no other path. I accept your proposal."


Lord Midel clapped you on the shoulder and said, "It's settled then -- I believe you are the one who can save our people from this wearing of the claw. Find the Pendant of Elinor, as the wizard has demanded, and bring it back to me. It is the only thing that can save our province. Now come, for I am not without magic of my own."


You gathered your things, said a solemn farewell to your family, and followed Midel into the center of town, where he sprinkled a sparkling powder over you, and recited an incantation... and you suddenly found yourself alone on a dirt path, the cold wind assailing your face.

Dirt Road


You are standing on a dirt road which extends east toward distant, mist-shrouded mountains. To the west, the road meanders into a tiny smudge of a town, perched on the vast ocean's edge. From here you can make out the mast of a ship which must ply its trade on that fearsome expanse.

You never wanted to be a scientist. It bored you, it did not interest you. 

But the years went by fast and before you knew it, you became a PhD student. All due to a new branch of science that emerged and caught your interest. With the research come access to the clean room. This clutter-free environment also helps you think. What you and your research group are working on could truly change the world. And, by the looks of it, will happen soon. If this falls into the wrong hands... 

Insomnia. Again. It was 2 in the morning when you got here, was it not? The clean room. Again. It calms you and really helps you focus on the work even with other personnel present. But you are currently alone. This is impossible. Protocol clearly dictates that at least one person from the maintenance crew has to be present at all times. They must have left earlier when you were too engrossed in your work to notice. Oh well. Time to go get out of this place, it must be early morning by now.

Clean Room


A white sterile-looking room with an assortment of technical equipment, yet covered completely in yellow by the light tubes above. The air temperature and humidity levels are strictly controlled and, much like your life, never change. Fan units are humming in the walls. There is an array of cabinets for storage.




The airlock door marked alpha to the east is your only way out.




One smaller cart is standing in a corner.

Isn't it always like that? You spent a hot morning chivvying the plow and the Bishop up and down the north field. No satisfaction there -- it's just to turn in the clover. The view and the Bishop's hind end never change -- a mule's ass no matter what you call the mule, and Reverd Pearson has lectured you enough about calling him "the Bishop," but you figure he's your mule so you can call him what you like -- the mule, that is, not Reverd Pearson -- anyway, a whole morning and now it's time to chop the wood, and your good axe has gone missing.




Reverd Pearson would say you're a careless lunkhead who'd lose his ear if it wasn't nailed on. You figure he's right, a man of the cloth, but that doesn't mean piskeys didn't steal the thing. You know about piskeys.

Your Front Room


Reverd Pearson says a man's home is his fortress. Your home is two rooms of dressed timber, but the roof doesn't leak, so that's fine. Not enough of a fortress to keep out the piskeys, though, it seems. The front door is west, and east is where you sleep in back.




A maplewood table stands in the center of this room
. It's your home's pride (though the Reverd has warned you about pride) -- a handsome furnishing that your cousin down the road made for you when your house was raised
. Every time you walk in you're pleased to see it. Only there should be an axe leaning against the table's corner, and there isn't
.




A battered book is lying on the table, though
.

book
: 
You pick it up off the table
. 
It's an old book of tales you borrowed from Reverd Pearson up at the chapel. He made you promise to take care of it, not that you'd ever let a book get ruined -- the chapel only has six books, six story books that is, the Reverd has his big Book up on his lectern, but that isn't this one. This is just stories. You like stories, and the Reverd likes you to practice your reading

Balcony


You are sitting. Sitting on your usual chair at the balcony. You are drinking milk coffee. You are waiting, but nothing ever changes. You don't know what you expect to change. But you are waiting. Something has to change, you know it. If you wait enough, something will change, you know it. You feel it.

It's become a matter of pride now not to give up. That tourist map of Paris must be up here somewhere in all this clutter, even if it has been five years since your last trip. And it's your own fault. It looks as if your great-grandfather was the last person to tidy up these lofts...

Attic


The attics, full of low beams and awkward angles, begin here in a relatively tidy area which extends north, south and east. The wooden floorboards seem fairly sound, just as well considering how heavy all these teachests are. But the old wiring went years ago, and there's no electric light.




A hinged trapdoor in the floor stands open, and light streams in from below.

"Los Angeles, California. City of Angels." 

"Not so fast, Sherlock; I'm no angel." She pauses, the cigarette poised an inch from her lips. A stray beam of sunlight leaks from a broken slat in the venetian blinds, spotlighting her hair. Blonde. Platinum, not gold. Abruptly, she reaches across your desk to push a stack of green at you, past the halfway point. Her eyes watch yours as she fans the money out on the desktop. "I never mix business with pleasure. Do you?" 

Not often. Not lately. "Not me," you assure her. "Wouldn't dream of it." 

She leans back in the chair, studies the smoke curling from the cigarette between her fingers. "I--we don't visit L.A. much anymore. My husband, he hates it; won't go near the place. Calls it the City of Angles. Says everybody's got one, you know? An angle, I mean." 

"Your husband sounds like a man with his head screwed on tight." 

She laughs, a short, bitter sound with no amusement behind it. "That night, I did go to L.A. Without Walter. When I got home, late, the cops were waiting for me." She kills the cigarette with a quick stab at the ashtray. "If Walter dies, I'll inherit millions. My alibi--well, let's just say it doesn't help. Get the picture?" 

Her old man was right, everybody's got an angle, even dames with more curves than a mountain road. A guy could hurt himself on all that geometry.

 (on

wooden swivel chair

Welcome to your executive office suite. Private. Furnished. Centrally located. Paid for this month--if all goes well--by the beautiful and wealthy Jessica Kincaid. Never mind the filthy window with a crack across one corner. Or the furniture that lost its polish years before you gained yours. Or the perpetual smell of onions from the diner across the street. What needs to work, does. You, mostly.


The door to the hall is north.

Just an average joe, maybe a little on the tall side, with enough weight and muscle to inspire second thoughts in almost anybody thinking about picking a fight.



From her handbag, Jessica extracts a newspaper clipping and unfolds it. "I don't know whether you've been following this case," she continues, "but here's a sample of what I'm up against." She reads:


"'Police have intensified their investigation into the brutal hit-and-run of real estate tycoon Walter Kincaid, who remains hospitalized since late Friday night. Although no witnesses to the incident have come forward, several people reported seeing a late-model white Jaguar convertible speeding through the area minutes before Kincaid was discovered. By all accounts, the driver, a blonde woman in her mid-twenties, was driving in a reckless and erratic manner. Authorities have not yet located the automobile; however, a similar vehicle is believed to belong to the victim's wife, who was not at home when the incident occurred.'" 

She glances up. "In case you haven't guessed, my car is a brand new '48 white Jag convertible. Or, rather, it was. It's missing." She wads the article into a ball and stuffs it back into her purse. "I'm in trouble, shamus. Deep trouble. I need you to get me out of it."

Unfortunately (or fortunately, if you enjoy large games), "Dangerous Curves" grew too large to include extensive hints within the game itself. The best advice I can give you is: don't spend all your money in one place. Oh, and talk to everybody. You did? Sometimes it helps to take your mind off your job for a while. Relax. Go to the movies. No, really, GO TO THE MOVIES. 

Listed below are a few commands you might want to try. The standard commands (like TAKE, LOOK, OPEN, etc.) work too, but the ones below might not occur to you:


ACCUSE <CHARACTER> does just that. 

BRIBE <CHARACTER> sometimes works and sometimes doesn't, just as in real life. 

BUY <OBJECT> or BUY <OBJECT> FROM CHARACTER handles the exchange of money automatically. 

CALL or DIAL <CHARACTER> or <LOCATION> or <NUMBER> will attempt to call the character, location, or telephone number you specify. 

DRINK <LIQUID> or EAT <FOOD> will try, if there's anything appropriate at hand. 

FOLLOW <CHARACTER> attempts to do just that. 

GO TO <LOCATION> (or, if you're in the car, DRIVE TO <LOCATION>) moves you one step closer to your destination each time you use it, even if you haven't yet visited the location. 

HOW MUCH IS <OBJECT> might prompt a helpful character to tell you the price of something. Then again, it might not. 

SLEEP will or won't, depending on how tired you are. 

WAIT UNTIL <TIME> or WAIT <N> MINUTES will wait the specified period of time. If something important happens before the waiting period is over, the game will interrupt you and ask if you wish to continue waiting. 

WHAT IS <OBJECT>, WHERE IS <OBJECT> or <CHARACTER>, WHO IS <CHARACTER>, or HOW IS <CHARACTER> might give you some helpful information. Then again, it might not. 

WRITE "text up to 60 characters in double quotes" will write a short note in your notepad.


If you have any comments or suggestions or, heaven forbid, bugs to report, I'd love to hear from you. Really.

Abruptly, Jessica Kincaid stalks past you into the corridor, an angry frown on her face. "If you don't need the money or the job," she snaps, "I'll find someone who does." The staccato of her high heels fades as she marches down the stairs and out of your life.




A few days later, you read in the paper that Walter Kincaid has died. 
The cops arrest Jessica as she leaves her husband's funeral, her dismay captured by a frenzy of popping flashbulbs and published on the front pages of newspapers throughout the state. After a long and public trial, she is convicted of his murder.
 You spend the next six months in an alcoholic stupor.

You have failed to do your job.

Actions seem meaningless here. You can't see or feel a thing. 



Foreign senses insinuate into your mind. Gradually you take in your surroundings...



Charles St. Station
 (on 
the 
bench
)


Tiny cracks and crumbling plaster. A grey ceiling dominates your view. Your back rests against something hard and cool.

=== darkiss1.z5 (v5) ===



You open your eyes, feeling alive again, after being... dead?

Who are you? You need some time to remember.

It's dark, but you can see.

You are in a sinister place, and should be frightened. Or perhaps not...

You are unbearably thirsty, but not for water.

Crypt
 (in 
the 
coffin
)


Hidden in the bowels of the mountain, this chamber has hosted your immortal body for centuries, while your foolish enemies spent their miserable days hunting for you in your castle. The coffin is on a stone pedestal at the centre of the room. On the ceiling is a fresco of the red sun of Valmar. To the east a narrow tunnel leads to the other rooms of your lair.



You're lying in the coffin, very weak. You struggle to keep your eyes open, while your necrotic flesh recovers its former appearance. You feel a stab of pain as you remember the stake that was driven through your heart. You should be dead, but you aren't. Something happened.

You're the nightmare from which people can't wake.

Dead twice. One by the hand of your maker, the second by the fiend who drove a stake through your heart while you were sleeping defenseless in your coffin.

Alive thrice, it seems, although this last one shouldn't be possible. Something happened.

=== death.z5 (v5) ===


It was only seconds ago that the sound of a gunshot caught you off guard.  Now, here you are, cradling your sidekick and friend, Snam, close to the ground.  "Not Snam!!" you think to yourself, "After all he's done for me..."  It was he who took care of your niece when your sister asked you to babysit.  It was he that always let you win in Stratego. Now, in this final act of selflessness, he lies dying from a shot from Doctor Nova's gun, leaking life from the very bullet that was meant for you.  Tears well up in your eyes when you think how Snam will never get that plant you got him for his birthday.  You spent so much time picking it out and everything...

Your attention is diverted by an evil chortle, and your gaze barely catches the blur of white as Doctor Nova runs out the door to the north.  You'll pursue him soon enough, but for now, your attention returns to your fallen comrade.

"Listen," Snam chokes out. "You gotta get that bastard." After these final words, his body promptly goes limp in your hands.  You carefully lower him to the floor.

"Oh, I'll get him alright," you growl to yourself as you turn towards the door.  "I'll get him good."

The Beginning of the End


You and Snam came a long way to get this far.  First, you had the trouble of tracking down clues and following the trail of innocent victims that led you here.  Then, there was the battle of epic proportions with Nova's countless minions.  To top it off, you had to deal with that dastardly crocodile pit (and you would've helped Snam wrestle them, too, if only reptile skin didn't make you feel so icky).

But now, Snam's dead and you've got to make things right.

You have an ominous, uneasy feeling, walking about this room. You're not sure whether to attribute this to the eerie, curious shadows that dart about the floor and walls or to the fact that you made the unwise decision to fight evil with a stomach full of chili. The doorway to the north seems to be your only exit.




Your friend, Snam, lies dead on the floor, face 
up.

The Beginning of the End


Mysterious, mysterious shadows dart about the room; the stench of evil is afoot.  Glory and justice lie to the north.




Your friend, Snam, lies dead on the floor, face

=== deephome.z5 (v5) ===










You crawl through the tight passageway, your lantern swinging in your hand, casting shadows that play about all around you.  Perhaps a human would be claustraphobic here, certainly one of the Elves would, but you are a Dwarven Reclaimer, sent to explore and prepare the abandoned city for the return of its people.  The ancient city awaits, just a little further up.  You shuffle farther in until you finally see the wooden doorway that brings a large bearded smile to your face.  You're there!  You have finally reached...

Secret Entrance


This is a rather dark and small room, having only two exits, back north the way you came, from the ancestral homes of Tana, or through the heavily barred wooden door before you that leads southwest and inward to the abandoned Deephome, abode of the Dwarves in Telleen.  It has been three hundred years since your people lived here.




The door blocks the way into the city of Deephome.

To look something up type "look up (something) in (something)"
To wield a weapon (use it in combat) type "Wield (Weapon)"
You can wear any armor you can hold
To cast a spell simply type the spell's name.  (i.e. to cast "Xyzzy" type "Xyzzy."  Simple, no?)
To speak to someone type "(Creature Name), something", or "Ask (Creature Name) About (something)."
I hope that helped.

Y2 Rock Room


You are in a large room, with a passage to the south, a passage to the west, and a wall of broken rock to the east. There is a large "Y2" on a rock in the room's centre.




Sitting on top of the Y2 rock is a featureless white cube.




A little red car is parked here.

Sitting atop a small white picket fence, you watch the children play in their backyard. Behind you, is old Mr. Harkin's place, an odd place, with an odd owner. What evil might we do today? As the Devil himself, you never tire of creating havoc amongst the little souls of the world. The more innocent the victim, well, all the more satisfying.

On the Fence


Sitting on top of a white picket fence, you can see several children playing in a backyard, and a larger yard behind you. You can get 'down' anytime you wish.

You're in.

The plan now is simple: go to your lab, plant the bomb, and run. The prototype will be destroyed. The military will have no way to continue the experiment. No-one will die.

The guard is out securing the grounds. The building is empty. You have six minutes.

Foyer


A darkened foyer, presided over by a security desk near the north wall. Floating above it in the capacious darkness is a small landing. A set of stairs both rises up to meet it and stretches downwards into the dark.




In the north wall is a closed automatic door.




To the south is a set of automatic doors leading out into the inky night.

Darkness; below, percussion throbs softly. You shift from foot to foot, conscious of too much open space around you.

Ahead and on either side, the voice of the chorus rises; as they speak, the lights slowly go up.

CHORUS:
Now does the hour grow close; where feet lack time,
And Spaniards rage before the Cockrel's gate,
The condemned sinner, soul turned sick of vice,
Shall craft before your eyes most unclean magics,
Open him a gate to Hell's black womb,
Release demons, and bid them convey
Our heroes to fair France; there to signal
Embattl'd men to a final desperate measure.
The final act is begun; the play is in your hands.

Stage (A German Forest)


You are onstage, a wide expanse of blank floor facing onto darkness. Nestled behind a curtain's edge is the exit leading offstage.

The backdrop features an unconvincing painting of pine-covered mountains and a dark, ominous sky in which a double-headed eagle is carrying off a schnitzel.

[ To go backstage, type 'backstage' or simply 'bs' ]

*An implosion of Purpose* 

A summons from mere existence.  The scattered undercurrents of Purpose integrated me, established meaning.

A wish diminished me.  I fulfilled my summoner's desire expending Purpose.  I returned to my container before I was lost forever.

Vault Entry Room


The location of my summoner was a room between the surface of the world [physically west] and a complex of vaults [physically east].

The room was a trap for physical beings.  On one side of the room
, a portcullis barred the way to the outside.
  To the other were the vaults for storage.  A patterned stone wall blocked their unauthorized access.




The remains of a former summoner rested there.  An emerald had taken the place of his head.




The summoner known as Seegan stood before me.

Vault Entry Room
Purpose:  
200
I was not impeded by the elements of the physical world.  The farther I traveled from the location of my initial summons, the more Purpose I expended.

Then too I realized where I was and could [recall the area] whenever I needed.

"It's a Dogs Life" is a text adventure game. You interact with the game by typing phrases like EXAMINE SHEEP or EAT COOKIE and the game will respond by describing the world around you and the results of your actions.


There are certain commands which are common to all adventure games. You move around by giving the compass direction in which you want to go; for example NORTH or SOUTHEAST. All directions can be shortened to one or two letters; in this case N or SE. You can also go UP or DOWN (U or D). In some locations IN or OUT work. You can also ENTER or CLIMB things.


When you first enter a location, the game will describe the location to you. After that, it will only tell you the name of the location. You can see the full description at any time by typing LOOK (or L). You can tell the game to always give the full description by entering VERBOSE.


You interact with the environment in many ways. You GET items to pick them up and DROP items to put them down. You can also PUT items IN things or GET items FROM others. Fairly complex sentences are possible, for example GET THE HAMMER FROM THE TOOL BOX THEN HIT THE WINDOW WITH THE HAMMER is a valid input (assuming that there happens to be a tool box with a hammer in it nearby).


You may encounter people or other creatures while exploring the world of the game. You can ask these people questions by typing ASK person ABOUT topic and tell them things by saying TELL person ABOUT topic. You can also SHOW them things. You can ask them to do things with PERSON, COMMAND. For example, to ask a character named Jack to get the keys type JACK, GET THE KEYS.


To look at an item more closely, EXAMINE it. (EXAMINE can be abbreviated as X) To get a list of everything you are carrying type INVENTORY (or I). Some other useful commands you can try are PUSH, SEARCH, SHAKE, THROW, RUB, KICK, CLIMB or READ. A part of any text adventure is learning what words the game knows "It's a Dogs Life" knows hundreds of common words (and a few not so common and X-rated ones), so feel free to try anything.


"It's a Dogs Life" is an experiment in programming interactive fiction using the Inform language. It is not a serious game, but one with which to have fun. If you like it (or hate it) or found any bugs in it, please send me some email at druid@princeton.crosswinds.net.


Much of this game is based around the personality (or should that be "doginality") of a typical Australian Cattle Dog. If you would like to learn more about these dogs, please visit the website at http://www.cattledog.com. If after visiting that website, you still want one of these beasties to call your very own, please check out  the Bull Run ACD Rescue website at http://www.crosswinds.net/princeton/~druid/acdrescue/rescue.html


Have Fun !!

=== doll.z5 (v5) ===





When you saw the ugly little doll in the shop window you knew you had to have it. It would make a great addition to your collection of mysterious items and artifacts.

The doll stood only about a foot tall and seemed to be made of a tough leathery material. Its head was small and misshapen, and its long, razor-sharp teeth could be seen protruding from its mouth. It wore a little gold talisman around its neck and wielded a cute little six inch sword. The sign read "Genuine African Zuni Doll. Only $19.99"

After bringing it home and taking it out of the box you read the little information sheet that came with it.


 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
"African Zuni Doll"




"It is said that the Zuni Doll is inhabited by the spirit of an African Tribesman who died while committing a cowardly act. In order to let the deceased regain his lost honor, the tribe's witch doctor imprisoned the man's spirit in a doll and a talisman that he created especially for that purpose. The spirit remains trapped until it atones for the cowardice the tribesman committed and proves its bravery. To accomplish this, the Zuni Doll must complete a near impossible task: hunt and kill, 25 human.

"Fortunately, the Zuni Doll is harmless as long as it continues to wear the gold talisman. The magic in the talisman keeps the Zuni Doll from coming to life and carrying out its mission of blood."

Now, you are lying in bed thinking of the little doll when you feel a slight pressure near your feet. Looking down you see your cat, Elmo, crawling towards you. You reach down and give Elmo a good scratch behind the ears. That is when you notice something small and golden drop from his mouth.

Don't Go


A bedroom. On the right is a bed, and a bookcase behind it. From the window across, beams of light are gliding inside. You can see a part of a building through the window.

Walls are white. A picture of flower is on the wall. A red rose with a black background. The bed with white sheets is undone.

A man with straggly hair in pajamas with dark blue stripes, is walking to left. He has fuzzy slippers. He's scratching his butt.

The reaching big white hand of the bed is about to hold the man from behind.

An open field



 As night approaches, and thick storms rise out from troubled skies.
   Like a spectre you appear.
   Called by a clap of thunder.

A messenger of death, the ghastly owl flutters, and with dreary shrieks he passes you by.

From somewhere far away a church bell sounds some early hour. Its sound crawls slowly through cold, mist laden air. 
A dead chime.

The bell has called you.
Out of space, out of time...

It is night. You find yourself standing in a grass field, surrounded by dark, shadowy trees. To the NORTH, the back stones of some ruined gothic structure rises high into the nights sky, silhouetted against a blood red moon.

It's black empty, windows, like eyes watch you far below.

Abbey ruins


As you walk through the mist towards the ruins you see a sign that reads.

"WHITBY ABBEY."

With a crack of thunder, through darkened air a flash of lightning comes, so broad and so bright, the Abbey seems on fire.

From high up, within one of the empty windows, the figure of a woman appears. Half hidden in the lions roar of the thunderclap, she calls to you.

"Why came you here?
Unwise...unwise...unwise!"

Lightning flashes, and when you look again she is gone.

All around you are the stone ruins of Whitby Abbey. A noble ruin of immense size.

Beautiful once.

Now all that is left are the great, dark walls. Their immense black stones eroded away by a century of sea wind.  From high up, two empty windows watch your progress far below. To the NORTH, beyond the Abbey's stone wall, you can hear the sea crashing against the rocks far below.

You wrench your eyes open. Rough grey stone. Grey stone 
ceiling.
 Your head hurts, and -- You're lying on the floor. You're staring at the ceiling, and it's rough and grey, and you don't recognize it.


You roll slowly (smooth cold floor?) and try to sit up. It hurts. You crawl upright. The walls, rough stone also, scrape your aching fingers. You can't -- there was white agony, felt like raw light tearing you apart. You can't remember anything after that.


You can't remember anything 
before
 that. Gone. You clutch at memory, and there's nothing but empty air.



Cell


This space, barely wider than outstretched arms, seems to have been chopped raw and square from unfinished stone. Only the floor is smooth -- a fine white surface beneath your feet
. There is a narrow gap in the east wall
.

=== dumont.z5 (v5) ===
You pull on a pair of jeans and a sweatshirt, collect your books and head out for class. Gregory Dumont, Ph.D. is giving one of his crash courses in physics and you swore this time you'd get the stuff down cold.

As you approach the classroom the smell of popcorn wafts through the door, and you find Dumont inside, showing a Marx Brothers movie to an empty room.

"Oh! So we have a class! Welcome!" Dumont says excitedly as he ushers you in. He looks at the film for a moment, chuckles, then switches it off. "Since it's just the two of us, and it's a nice day, why don't we walk over to the Research Zone? I'm working on an experiment there," Dumont says, scratching his wild frizzy hair then reaching for his coat. "We can consider it a lab class."

The Research Zone, shrouded in mystery since the last big experiment blew the roof off the billion-dollar facility, has been off limits to students. You are honored that Dr. Dumont is allowing you, a lowly physics student, access to a privileged area.

After walking for what feels like miles down the brightly lit twisty hallways of the Research Zone, Dumont stops abruptly and opens a door. Fumbling for a light switch inside, you hear him cursing under his breath, "Ah, here it is!" and the room is washed in light.

Inside there are mounds of books, magazines, popcorn, clustered around a massive wooden desk while across the room is a curtained area. Dumont sees you eyeing the curtain. "Shall we see what's behind curtain number three?" he asks you with a sly smile.

He pulls the curtain back briskly and a chill runs up your spine. There, amidst a tangle of wires, computers and a huge wall poster of the university's underground particle smashing cyclotron, sits a gleaming, black, human-shaped shell the size of a sports car. The lid is open.


"You see, it's quite simple. Particle physics isn't particle physics without human observation--it's just particles. So, when we insert one human, voila! Particle physics!" Dumont looks at you with a gleam in his dark blue eyes. "You're not taking notes?" he asks as he walks to a computer console.

Slowly, he fingers a few buttons while lost in some unfathomable thought processes, his gaze intent on the black shell. Luckily, he seems to be busy with things other than you.

Just as you start to think it might be prudent to find your way out through the labyrinthine hallways, he pulls up a lab stool for you to sit on. There is an intensity about him that rivets your attention. You can feel his excitement as he looks inside the black shell, checking wires that run along the inside.

"The shell is linked to the A.I. computer, which is linked to the cyclotron. The computer will learn from interacting with the human mind how to view the elusive particle which has escaped our detection so far--Particle X. Sort of a creative jump start, if you will," he says. "The computer just doesn't have the intelligence needed by itself."

Dumont sheds his coat and reaches for a white lab coat draped over a chair. "Now, the A.I. machine loads metaphors into the human brain for what is going on inside the cyclotron. And the human brain, being creative, tries to find meaning within the metaphors and, ultimately, views Particle X. Once that happens, the A.I. computer adjusts, learns, and becomes a particle viewing machine. And then, voila! The human can go home and get some sleep!"

He pulls the lab coat on and excitedly jabs a few buttons on the computer. "Then, you ask, what must it be like inside the shell, linked to a metaphor of the sub-atomic world?" You weren't even thinking of asking that. You were thinking of asking if you could transfer into another physics class. Any other physics class. "Now that's the interesting part," he continues. "I did most of the programming for P.A.R.T.I. myself--Particle Accelerator and Reality Translation Integrator.'


Dr. Dumont begins to pick up speed as he talks, whisking you and your imagination along with him. He grabs the lapels of his own lab coat as if to shake himself. "There's a shortcut to genius inside of P.A.R.T.I. somewhere, but you know I'm afraid the metaphors will be too personal for just anybody to make sense of them, too much of my own personality, my likes and dislikes."

He shakes his head, "But who knows?!! They won't let me try it out! I could be the first human to experience sub-atomic life, but do they give me that honor? Nooooo!" Dumont gestures wildly as he talks. "They've decided to train a subonaut, someone who will be groomed for the mission."

He throws back his mane of wild hair and laughs. "Subonaut! Sheesh!" He paces across the room then turns to you. "The experience will take only a few moments, but it won't feel that way to the person inside the shell. Time will be suspended and drawn out, rather dramatically I suspect."


Dr. Dumont leans forward, peers at you as if to see whether you've taken it all in, then steps over to the shell. He adjusts a wire inside the shell.

"If I could just make a few adjustments, but the darn subonaut hasn't been selected yet..."

He turns his piercing blue gaze on you, "Would you mind? Getting in the shell I mean? Just for a moment? I only need the physical dimensions of a body, yours will do fine," he says happily, gesturing to the awaiting interior.

You look at the black acrylic shell, not so chilling as when you first laid eyes on it. Dumont seems so intent on adjusting those wires in the shell, you feel compelled to help him out. Maybe this will even boost your grade, you speculate, as you slide into the contours of its inner dimensions. Dumont reaches over you to bring down the biolink electrodes, attaching the small wired disks to your temples, your arms, torso, and legs.

"Now, where did I put that screwdriver?" Dumont ruminates, as he disappears out of sight for a second.

The second draws out. You get fidgety. You hear the deep thrumming of the particle accelerator, feel its vibrations through the shell. Dumont doesn't seem to be returning. As you pull yourself up for a peek, your hand hits something along the outer edge of the shell and you hear an ominous click. The black shell quickly begins to close as you get a glimpse of Dumont running across the room shouting, "Oh my Gosh! Stop! Wait!" and then the shell lid clicks securely shut.

The last thing you hear is Dumont shouting, "This isn't going to get you an A, you know!" before you black out.

Bedroom


You're in a bedroom. Everything about this room seems normal on one level and yet oddly different on another. A quick scan around the room makes you ill-at-ease, as if you don't belong here. Or perhaps the room itself doesn't belong anywhere. A dresser complete with a mirror lies off to one side, against a white, featureless wall. A door is off to the west while to the south, through a doorway, you can see what must be a small bathroom.

Life is pretty routine. Search for Food. Eat it. Hide from Enemies. Ignore the Others. Then one day, you notice a staggeringly tall Edifice, right here in the middle of the forest. Has it been here before?

You are well adapted to your environment. Your long arms and legs allow you to easily climb and swing in trees; your fur makes it easier to withstand the occasional cold night. Your colleagues seem to think your opposable thumbs make you look funny, which is why you spend so much time alone, but all in all, they've worked out pretty well.

=== enter.z5 (v5) ===


 "Another thrilling day at Neil Armstrong Middle and Elementary School," you think, with studied irony, as you get off the bus, trying to look as cool and bored as the other eighth graders. In truth, though, you really are a little excited and nervous, because today is Valentine's Day, and you have a special job to do, delivering Enterprise Candy Grams to classes all around the building. And best (and worst) of all, your delivery partner will be Judy, on whom you've had an incredible crush since before you knew what a crush was.

You are Doug DeGrace, a lanky, thirteen-year old eighth grade student at the only public school in Nom de Plume, North Dakota, a town of five thousand souls in the north central part of the United States, which boasts of being "The Coldest French-Named Town in the EN-tire US of A." Today's temperature does nothing to contradict the town's unofficial slogan.

As you enter the middle school side of the building, which is totally separate from the section for kids younger than ten, you see a huge red poster advertising the biggest social event of the year, the Valentine's Day Dance. The dance is tonight, but you're not at all sure you'll be going. After a quick trip to your locker, you arrive at the middle school cafeteria, where your school day starts.

The Cafe


The Neil Armstrong Middle and Elementary School Cafeteria is a big, unadorned room that echoes like Carlsbad Caverns whenever there's any noise at all, though it's quiet here now.  There's an exit to the west; and a door to the north leads to the Enterprise closet, where materials for your special task of the day are stored.


Mr. Alltext enters the cafeteria from the west.  He's a small man in his fifties and is wearing a "Save the Children" tie. 

"Hi!," he says. "It's good to see you're all on time. Here's the key to the closet, Doug." He gives you a brass key. "Judy will be working with you, and so will the new girl who's joining us today.

"Since you worked as a record keeper on our last candy gram project and Judy handled the actual deliveries, the two of you will swap those roles today.  The new girl will serve mainly as an observer.

"All the paperwork you'll need is on the shelf in the closet.  So are the cards and candy pops you'll be delivering. By the way, there are some unsold pops in the envelope.  Feel free to buy and deliver them, if you like."

"Any questions about your job today?"

Judy flops herself down on one of the cafeteria stools.  She's blond and pretty, and she's chewing a big wad of gum.

The new girl is known by the odd nickname "Queenie," or so you've been told.  She approaches you and Judy, limping a little. She seems quiet, but not especially shy or nervous. Queenie has a small scar on her cheek. 

Judy raises her hand, even though only three students are in the area.  Mr. Alltext replies a bit ruefully, as if he's expecting something odd, "Yes, Judy."

"Can I go the bathroom?" Judy inquires. 

Mr. Alltext pauses, collects himself for a moment, and replies, "I don't think that qualifies as a question about our special task for today, Judy, but I'll answer anyway. No. You may not. However, in a few minutes, you'll be on your own (Heaven help us!), delivering the candy grams, and so you'll be able to make your own hygienic choices."

"OK," she comments amiably.

(If this is your first experience with interactive fiction, you should probably now type INTRO.  If you've read other works of interactive fiction but are trying this one for the first time, you should probably type ABOUT.)

(If you need a hint for one of the story's puzzles, type HINT. To see a walkthru, type WALKTHRU.)

=== entropy.z8 (v8) ===



Smoke pillars rise from the landscape like ghostly skyscrapers while debris-filled craters mark every visible portion of land. Fires pollute the air and ashes drift like schools of dead fish. Bones, still holding flesh as if they might yet be resurrected, lie about in numbers beyond comprehension.

The disaster was swift and the destruction wholesale.

You stand alone, face disfigured, hips bent to the left, innards exposed on your arms, legs, and abdomen. The enemy has moved on, swiftly destroying the entire planet. 

You stare through blue, mechanical eyes, methodically traversing your surroundings, hoping to find some sign that you did not completely fail.

Lost Battlefield


In all directions the land is a waste. Craters, bones, flesh  smoke litter the entire landscape while ashen clouds form dark and foreboding shapes in an angry red sky. The earth trembles from dislocated tectonic plates and the atmosphere is quickly becoming unbreathable and unlivable. A smoking forest can be seen to the west, a large steel-gray city is burning to the north, and the edge of an enormous smoldering crater lies to the east.

Standing about a meter and a half in height, your external feminine coverings are nearly unrecognizable beyond the damage done in battle. You examine yourself and once again shrug at the human engineer that decided to make you in her own image. Outside of the normal humaniform features is a wide utility belt built into your waist

Edge Of City


Standing on the southern edge of the largest city on the planet, you survey the results of thermonuclear war. Although some structures remain standing, there is nothing left but the plasteel infrastructures of once proud and magnificent towers and buildings. A dense fog of death parades around the city in dust-devil frenzy. The stench of burnt flesh and fused materials is overwhelming and guards the city far better than its previous occupants ever could.

Eric The Power-Mad Dungeon Master
by Mark Arenz
(c) 2004


[9:38pm on a Saturday in 1981.  D&D night at Eric's]



Long ago ... in the time of Arbaldu, lord of the short forest- or something like that-

Josh: Can we just get on with this?

Everybody shut the hell up!  This is how things go every time I DM, and I'm sick of it.  You guys seem to think you can back-sass the Dungeon Master and get away with it.   Well, just remember that I have the power to smite you all at will.

Brad: You keep saying that, Eric, but I'm not convinced that you know what it means.

My finger is on the smiting button right now.  Don't test me.


[MORE]



Oh, a little bad news first.  Some Yoohoo may or may not have been spilled on the new map.

Josh: You've got to be kidding.

Mistakes were made, alright?  Get over it.  The good news is that I memorized the whole thing when we were making it last week, so everything will be fine like cherry wine.  Let's get started.

A clearing


Large and ancient trees surround you in this perfectly circular clearing.

Looking at the smudge on the map, I'm pretty sure you can head North or Southwest from here.

Grand Central Forrest


From the trampled grass here, you can tell this is a heavy traffic area.  This is no wonder since paths lead off in most directions from the spot where you now stand.  Off to the West, you hear a subtle gurgling sound.  To the East you can see the gates of a small town.


Brad: Let's not go to Camelot.  It is a silly place.

=== f209.z5 (v5) ===





As we sew the tapestry of our lives, we work with only one thread at a time.  Some are bright, some dark, some with colors we can't quite describe.

At the moment, you are working with one particularly dull, frayed thread, and one sorry excuse for a needle.  The events of the past year are immaterial right now.  All you know is that "home" is not what it used to mean, and this is not where you want to be.

If you could just get away... even for an hour or two.

Living Room


This is the cultural center of apartment F209.  Its true symbolic magnificence is once again belied by its current squalid nature.  You wonder for a while how anyone could actually live in a place like this, until you remember that you pay the rent here.  The endless white of the undecorated walls is interrupted only by a hallway to the south, the kitchen to the east, and the front door to the north.




The front door is closed, displaying its chipped, off-white countenance with pride.




A large, selfish cat stares at you impatiently.

<<

The is fog everywhere, obscuring the entire landscape. Max feels suddenly like a huge cloud has lifted him up and taken him away. He wonders where he has gone.

=== fantasydimension.z3 (v3) ===
You find yourself standing in a small airlock, the sound of rushing air filling your ears. The walls around you are smooth and metallic, and the only light comes from a small panel on the far side of the room. As you approach it, the panel beeps and a message appears on the screen.

"Welcome to the Airlock," it reads. "This facility is designed to protect against the harmful effects of interdimensional travel. Please wait for the pressure to equalize before proceeding."

As you stand there, you realize that you have no idea how you got here. The last thing you remember was sitting at your desk, working hard on a project. But now, you're in some sort of high-tech airlock, and you can feel the pressure slowly equalizing around you.

After a few moments, the panel beeps again, and you hear a voice through a speaker above the screen. "Please state your intended destination."

You pause for a moment, trying to think of what to say. You're not even sure where you are, let alone where you want to go.

"Umm, home, I guess?" you say tentatively.

There's a brief pause, and then the voice speaks again. "I'm sorry, but we are unable to comply with that request. This facility is for interdimensional travel only. Please state your desired dimension."

You frown, feeling a bit frustrated. What the hell is going on? But then, an idea occurs to you.

"Fantasy world," you say decisively.

There's a moment of silence, and then the voice speaks again. "Very well. Initiating interdimensional travel sequence. Please stand by."

You feel a sudden jolt, and the airlock begins to vibrate around you. Then, with a hiss of escaping air, the door on the other side of the room slides open.

Airlock


The airlock is a small, metallic chamber, with smooth walls that seem to be made of some sort of advanced alloy. The only source of light is a small panel on the far side of the room, which is displaying information about the airlock and its purpose.

As you look around, you notice that there are two doors leading out of the chamber. The inner door, closest to you, is closed, and appears to lead back to your home dimension. It's made of the same material as the walls. The outer door, which is on the far side of the chamber, is open and reveals a breathtaking view of the world beyond. You can see rolling hills, dense forests, and towering mountains in the distance, and the air around the doorway is filled with the scent of flowers.

The sets were gaudy and the singing both tuneless and tasteless. But who goes to the Sickleburg Opera for the sets or for the singing?

It is nearly dawn, and at last you've come back to your chamber. Soon you might SLEEP, but first, LOOK around, EXAMINE your surroundings if you wish, take INVENTORY of your possessions, and TAKE OFF the things you are wearing.

Chamber
You glance at yourself in the mirror.




Your face, of an unhealthy, fashionable hue, sags a bit after this long and frenzied night.
 Atop it sits an immaculate, saffron-colored top hat.
 The jacket you're wearing almost seems to shine in the gloom.
 Your silk cape hangs down behind you, still as cerecloth now that you're no longer rushing about.
 At the edges of the mirror are your gloved hands, which, after the exertions of the evening, hang in relaxation like white, thin-lobed fruits.

Sickleburg is a strange and mutable city, and there is no guarantee of consistency between this and any other portrayals of it.

=== forms.z5 (v5) ===





Summer on a college campus is rarely exciting, and this year is no exception. Your fellow students won't be returning for three more weeks, and the endless grind of your job at the computer center is not anyone's idea of entertainment.

Yesterday was the first of September, and autumn is moving in. But the long drag of classes won't start for weeks. Restless would be one way to describe your mood; bored sick would be another.

Last night, you had odd dreams: a circle, turning endlessly, and carrying you on its back across strange lands; yourself grown double, and dueling with cold-blazing swords; and others, stranger yet.

Then the alarm went off, and you emerged into another mundane day. Maybe something will come along to entertain you....

In Your Room


Clutter and mess spread their way across the floor of your smallish room in Wall House, just west of the main campus. A door leads south to the hall, another west to the closet. Windows face east and north. Your desk sits against one wall, next to the north window.




Your old computer sits on the desk.




A mirror hangs on the west wall, by the closet door.

You wake up. You have no memory of who you are, or where you are, or what you have been doing. A peculiarly vibrating, tinny music pours from an invisible source. Then you see the tremendous chunk of stone falling towards you...

Okay, so maybe this isn't a serious entry in the interactive-fiction contest. Please don't give away the joke to anyone else (on Usenet, or elsewhere.)


If you find that pieces aren't falling on their own (I mean, if they only fall when you hit Z or Space) it's not my fault. Not all interpreters support the timed-input opcodes.

=== frozen.z5 (v5) ===









End of term is just two days away and you still haven't finished that story you have due for your english professor.  Since it's worth half of your grade you figure now would be a good time.  Unfortunately for you, your computer decided that it needed to self-destruct.  So here you are in the Engineering building computer lab, a place you usually only see during your computer science labs, along with a half dozen other desperate souls, striving to cram a month's worth of work into a single night.  Rather familiar territory now that you think about it.  As is the light doze you just jerked yourself out of.  Time to get some coffee...

Computer Lab


A low hum is the only sound that arises from the serried ranks of computers.  The few remaining students, shackled like slaves to the projects in front of them, appear almost frozen in the glare from the flourescent lights.  You can escape to the northeast.




Everyone is still, apparently they can't think and type at the same time.



You

computer
 and 
a
 
back pack
 (which is closed)
 here.

Students
: 
Not only do they look like statues, they feel like it too.  Especially in regards to their heavy and immovable properties.  No matter how you strive, they refuse to move an inch.


computer
: 
The computer department is a little paranoid about its equipment.  The computer is chained, bolted, and shackled to the desk.  You'd have better luck moving the students.


back pack
: 
Your muscles strain as you heave at the unmoving bag.  Just as your about to give up in frustration the bag starts moving, and you swing it onto your shoulder before it stops again.

The tour had been going exceedingly well up to this point. You've always yearned to visit a Ghost Town and your affection for the Old West has never been stronger. It stemmed from your early years of playing Cowboys and Indians with the neighborhood gang. When the opportunity came up, this was a no-miss trip! A remote town on the old Texas-Mexico border that has been left untouched and well-preserved in the arid climate for more than a century. This is exactly the vacation that you have craved! At one time, this place was a bustling little frontier town of notable repute. Nameless now, the town was once filled with frontiersmen. "Gauchos" the underpaid South American tour guide kept calling them. Cowboys by any other name. It doesn't matter what nationality a cowboy is, he remains an icon and a legend. You couldn't wait to get here - when you logged out of the Geek and set your Facebook status to 'On Vacation', you were going totally tech-free, just like the pioneers did. Even more special is that this particular no-name town was founded by none other than General Jebbidiah Alden in 1865. A Civil War hero who made it his mission in life to help rebuild after the destruction caused by the war. General Alden was well-liked and well-respected. History remembers him kindly. His descendants still live only a few hundred miles from the site of this now long-abandoned ghost town. Unfortunately, your allergies have kicked in at the worst possible time. Before long the tour guide was speaking but all you could concentrate on was the stuffiness in your head. Breathing became a labor and staying alert a chore. If you could just rest your head for a few minutes... It wasn't exactly clear when you fell asleep, but the tour guide and your fellow tourists have moved on without you. The last thing you can remember is the tour guide saying that the group could take a short break for lunch, take a last look around and then get back on the bus for the trip home. As you wake up, you can hear the clunker of a bus pull out of the parking lot to the north. 

Welcome to Gaucho! Your goal is to survive one (1) night here in this ghost town so you can be picked up by the next tour bus that will arrive in the morning. With your allergies acting up, you'll need a good night's sleep to make it through. And you are so thirsty that you'll never be able to sleep without a good long chug of water. To survive in this old frontier town, you will need all of your wits to combat puzzles and obstacles that stand in your way. As you progress, you will uncover various special items and, quite possibly, some gold. At the end of your adventure (if you either Win or Quit), you will be given a unique code that you can use on the Geek to claim special microbadges and geekgold. At any time during the game, you can type SCORE to see your progress. If you wish to give up and simply claim your earned prizes, you can type QUIT. If you win the game, it will be obvious as to how to claim your prizes. The maximum score for this game is 100. If you need a bit of generic help, type HELP. Good luck!

Secluded Alley


You are standing in a secluded alley. The sun is mostly shielded by the buildings to either side and to the south. To the north, you see the road and parking lot where the bus had previously been. Behind you is a thick wall, with a nice soft pile of dirt to nap on. But now that the wind is picking up, blowing straight into the alley, you doubt that you'd be able to sleep there anymore!

Welcome to **GAUCHO** - An Interactive Geek Western
Happy 3-year Anniversary RPG Geek!

To complete this adventure you will rarely need to type more than 2 simple words that almost always take the form of VERB NOUN. That is... TAKE BLANKET or DIG GRAVE are the types of commands you will enter. Very occasionally you might need to be more specific... for example: DIG GRAVE WITH SHOVEL. To move in a direction, you can type GO NORTH or simply N. To list the things you're currently carrying type: Inventory or simply Inv. Keep it simple! One important command is LOOK which will re-display the contents of the room. This can be crucial.

If you are really stuck, take a break and come back to it - often things are more clear in the morning. Be sure to read and re-read paragraphs carefully. Often some nugget of information or clue is buried within. Lastly, if you are really off the deep-end going nuts with a puzzle and can't work it out, post on the forums over on www.rpggeek.com where we'll have a thread running to help those who are stuck during the contest period (July 29th - August 5th, 2012).

Notes from Dave: I swore I'd never write another site-wide adventure. And yet here I am after midnight with my wife and cats soundly asleep and I'm coding up the final puzzles. I suppose it's the satisfaction from crafting fiction that others can play through and enjoy. In the end, I estimate more than 80 hours of coding and debug has gone into this adventure on my part. Add to that the many hours the designers spent writing text and designing puzzles along with the 10 unique microbadges for the game plus a kick-ass trailer from Drewdane and it all adds up to one thing: pure insanity. I shall say it again - in writing this time: never again! This adventure was inspired by a Scott Adams Adventure game called GHOST TOWN which I played on my friend's TI-99/4a via data-loading cassette back in 1981. The glow of that phosphor has not yet faded from my eyes... (you can play this amazing primitive adventure at http://www.ifiction.org/games/index.php?cat=44)

Notes from Steven: Dave roped me into another one of these, but I can't say I went unwillingly. It was great fun fleshing out the story and getting into the swing of the old west, largely inspired on my end by good ol' Boot Hill and the three or so Westerns I've watched - and, of course, the beautiful microbadges and even more beautiful game trailer! Thanks to all of my collaborators, playtesters, and the badge/video folks for making this such a good experience. I hope you enjoy the puzzles, the story, and the humor - and I look forward to the day the Gaucho finally delivers the goods!

Notes from Jason: I have never written a damned thing that's seen light of day before now;  so I would like to thank Dave and Steve for this opportunity to dive feet first this project. It was a challenge to get up to speed on the vision Dave and Steve had, and I hope I was up to the task of bringing GAUCHO to life. Only time will tell...so grab your ten-gallon hat, strap on your six-shooter, pardner; it's time to enjoy GAUCHO!

You amble your way to the north.



Old Post Road


A wide, dusty road stretches east and west here, punctuated only by a few cracks in the dry earth. Decrepit buildings - few safe to enter after their many years of decay - line both sides of the street. To the north is the parking lot where the Wavemotion Tour Bus deposited you just a couple of hours ago - now empty, with a pair of tire marks stretching across the hard-packed ground back to the highway. Directly to the south is the secluded alley where you rested.




A large dark wooden wagon wheel, about three feet across, rests against a hitching post. The wood looks solid enough, though a few of the spokes show some cracks.

You hear a distant rumbling sound.




Welcome to Goodbye Doggy World.
 
Beware of the wandering vapor.




south end of the graveyard


You are at the entrance to the graveyard. A heavy iron gate creaks in the wind. A stone path runs north through the center of the graveyard.

Goodbye Doggy World


middle of the graveyard


A stone path runs north and south through the center of the graveyard. In the middle of the path is an old wooden bench. To the east is a vicious gnarled old tree, to the west is an ancient, leprous, small stone crypt.



A fog slowly drifts in from the 
north end of the graveyard

Goodbye Doggy World

=== geb.z5 (v5) ===


In the dream, you are made of stars. You shine with a fierce, penetrating light, and you are pursuing a lightless void. Just as you are about to reach it, you wake up. As you slowly become more aware, you listen closely. Tap. Tap. Tap-tap. "Suddenly there came a tapping"?  It sounds like it's coming from the kitchen. You leap out of bed with no clear idea of what to do if there is an actual intruder, but curiosity compels you to find out...

Your bedroom


More by memory than by the dim light can you find your way south to the kitchen or east to your workshop. The back door is a faint outline to the north.

The back yard


This side of the yard is green and almost perfectly level. The night air is just the right temperature, and you have an excellent view of the stars. As long as the wind isn't blowing out of the trees to the north, it smells just as pleasant.

=== geist.z5 (v5) ===






You were celebrating the arrival of the not-quite-second-half of the 21st century with your buddies in your gaming basement when the bad news arrived: Crazy Uncle Scott had finally given up the good fight and passed off into gaming nirvana. He was an unusual man, with a firm belief that the world went to hell in a hand-basket with the arrival of text messages, always claiming that their phones were smarter than them! So he bought himself a huge mansion and spent his last days there pining for the glory days of yore, when websites were nothing more than acres of bright blue links thrown willy-nilly onto a computer screen.

Somehow, though, he took a shine to you, and you were smart enough to hide your smartphone whenever he came calling. Nevertheless, it was quite a surprise to learn that he left you exactly half his will. And even more of a surprise to discover that the lawyer's language was precise: not half his massive fortune in Geekgold, but literally half his will. Along with a short note explaining that to collect your full inheritance, you must retrieve the second half of Crazy Uncle Scott's will from his old estate, Alden Manor. The very name brings chills to your spine: that place is haunted!

But the true horror lay in the closing passage of the note:

Leave your Smartphone at home!

At the Front Gate


And so it stands before you, a house that could have been cozy, if not for the peeling blue paint, the flying gargoyles encircling the roof, and the looming twelve-foot tall fence with 'WARNING: Electrified' painted in blood red letters. The yard on this side of the fence continues to the east and west. The main gate, dutifully keeping you out of Alden Manor proper, lies directly to the north. If you wish to give up on this grand adventure, there is a path leading south back to civilization.

Welcome to **GEIST** - An Interactive Geek Horror.


Happy new year, RPG Geek!

To complete this adventure you will rarely need to type more than 2 simple words that almost always take the form of VERB NOUN. That is... TAKE BLANKET or OPEN COVER are the types of commands you will enter. Very occasionally you might need to be more specific... for example: OPEN COVER WITH PRYBAR. To move in a direction, you can type GO NORTH or simply N. To list the things you're currently carrying type: Inventory or simply Inv. Keep it simple! One important command is LOOK which will re-display the contents of the room. This can be crucial.

If you are really stuck, take a break and come back to it - often things are more clear in the morning. Be sure to read and re-read paragraphs carefully. Often some nugget of information or clue is buried within. Lastly, if you are really off the deep-end going nuts with a puzzle and can't work it out, post on the forums over on www.rpggeek.com where we'll have a thread running to help those who are stuck during the contest period (Jan 5 - Jan 15th, 2014).

Notes from Dave:   I swore I'd never write another site-wide adventure. Twice. I'm nothing if not consistent. But here I am again in the trenches and with some of the finest creative minds to help with another fantastic adventure. There are more small touches and fine brush strokes in this game than most people will ever see - but I hope you take the time to explore the game fully. If this is your first Interactive Fiction game (aka Text Adventure), I hope you get the same feeling I got when I played Zork for a summer in stunning green-screen mono all those many years ago.

Notes from Jonna:  Gaucho (the site-wide event at 2012) was the first ever Interactive Fiction game I played, so it's only fitting that the first ever time I'm part of the team writing one, should be the next site-wide event. I felt very safe taking my first steps with the experienced team that helped me whenever I was stumbling. Writing an IF has been at least as much fun as playing one, if not even more. It's been amazing ride and I'm looking forward to seeing people playing the game and having fun with it.

Notes from Dean:   I just wanted to say thanks to Dave, Jonna, and Steve for letting me run amok in their playground. It's been a real treat. :)

Notes from Steven: This is the third time I've helped with a site-wide adventure, and I must give huge props to my collaborators for their energy, writing talents, and incredible ideas. It was a pleasure to watch this one unfold from Dave's rough sketch to the finished product - the creative process was full of twists and turns, and I hope you have the same experience of wonder playing it that we had creating it! Don't take it too seriously and take the time to look around - I think you'll enjoy the journey.

Even before you make contact, an arc of electricity jolts through you. It hurts, my precious! You decide not to push your luck further.

1935 December 24th.
9:05PM:

With lights blazing, the midnight express thunders through the night. On silver moonlit track it races clear. Its mournful steam whistle sounds across a sleeping countryside.

We are carried at speed, in sumptuous first class comfort, past a sleeping village, then beyond through the opening of a tunnel, and out into the open again.

The steam engine "Bluebell," races fast and clear through falling snow. Through dark and gloomy woods, over a bridge and on into the night.

A First Class Carriage


You are on your way home to spend Christmas with your family, and what a splendid start to the holiday. A first class train ride, from the cold winters fog of London, to the clean air of the family home in Torquay.

Sitting in the carriage, across the table from you is Ingrid. Ingrid is your closest friend and is to spend the Christmas holiday with you.

This first class coach is alive with Christmas spirit; from the excited conversation of your fellow travellers, to the brightly coloured Christmas presents they have in their luggage. The carriage itself is full of sumptuous detail. High back, plush ruby red seating. Golden oak tables, and decorated wall panels. All lit by the orange flame of brass oil lamps.

Outside the windows, deep dark woods rush past.



On 
the 
table
 is
 
a 
newspaper
.

You are standing in a forest.


THE FOREST


Dense rows of gnarled trees stretch as far as you can see. Dead leaves litter the damp ground. The air is still and cold.

Gazing to the north, you sense more than see the looming mass of GHOST MOUNTAIN.

You are suddenly aware of the silence that surrounds you, as though you are the only living presence for miles around.



THE FOREST


You are surrounded by trees.

GHOST MOUNTAIN looms to the north.




There is a small pile of earth at the base of a nearby tree.

You kept telling your English teacher you'd have his copy of Waiting for Godot back "tomorrow". He's getting sick of waiting; you'd better find it tonight. You have just completed a thorough search of the porch, finding nothing but a rotting fish.

Porch


This is your porch. Icky. Books, papers, filth, and stuff you don't seriously want to think about is all over the place. Your book isn't here, though... where the bleep is it?

The kitchen is to the west, the back door of your house is to the south.




A herring lies dead on the porch floor... you don't want to know.



You
 can 
also 
see 
a
 
small brown box
 (which is closed)
 here.

Man, what a party! That was a night to remember - actually it'll be a miracle if I remember it at all tomorrow!  Oh, by the way, I'm Goldilocks. I'm a nineteen year old blonde bombshell and I'm on my way back from yet another crazy art school party. It's about five AM and the sun's already up, as are the birds, who are doing their level best to aggravate my hangover with their bloody singing! I could really use something to eat and somewhere to sleep off this hangover, but something tells me I shouldn't have taken this shortcut through the forest. I have a really baaad feeling about it...

Goldilocks is a FOX!

In the enchanted forest


A large wooden sign informs me that I'm in the Enchanted Forest. What it doesn't tell me is how the hell I get out! Everywhere I look there are trees, trees, trees. This place definately has a 'tree' theme going. A clearly marked path leads south and west, whilst in every other direction are, well, trees.


An old pedlar is sitting on a log here, tending to his bunions.

=== gsdemo.z8 (v8) ===


A bead of sweat rolls down your cheek as you steel yourself for the task at hand.  Gripping the steering wheel of your car tightly, you shift the idling car into drive and floor the gas pedal as you sharply twist the wheel to the left.  Your car obediently careens to the left rocketing past a brown wooden sign marked "Greystone Psychiatric Hospital".

Your car roars through the still night air as you hurtle towards an ominous and colossal building with a tower jutting towards the star-filled sky.  Sweating profusely as you ponder your future in that dark place, you swerve your car into two parking spaces, slamming on the brakes effecting the horrendous skidding noise you were hoping for.  Flinging open the door to your car you stumble out and towards the large double doors to the facility.  Staggering over to the counter you loudly announce the fact you are suicidal but that you don't want to die.

Within seconds, two orderlies rush over slide you into a wheelchair as a nurse consults her clipboard, efficiently asking you several questions about yourself. After the lengthy Q&A session, there is an extensive screening process. Finally, you are wheeled directly to a private room where the orderlies confiscate all of your belongings, methodically search them and hand you a simple hospital gown to wear.  Your visit to Greystone has begun.


The Greystone Test Drive lets you explore a section of the main building and some of the grounds. Also, you can interact with some of the patients, a staff member and even your own assistant, a state trooper. In the full, unrestricted version of Greystone the entire story is open to you.

Your Room


Dreary takes on new meaning as your eyes wander over the chipping paint on the walls of your small, dimly lit room.


Sparsely furnished with a single bed, a plain nightstand and an equally plain dresser and little else, you don't half wonder why more people don't crazy while in Greystone's care.  A darkened doorway leads west while a hallway is north.

Life on Gue Street.


I highly suggest typing "About" if this is your first time playing this.


The little, invaluable self-deceptions we allow ourselves. Sometimes they're the only things that make adventuring bearable. Today, for example, you're taking a walk on Gue Street beneath a cloudless summer sky. Not surprising; you've been adventuring around this neighborhood almost every day to enjoy the warm weather and plentiful treasure. You've walked down this street, and dozens identical to it all across Quendor, countless times, reveling in the little details, taking an adventurer's pleasure in noting how the whole architecture of the game seems to change based on what you type. The placement of a single "N" or "Kill Troll" or the calibrated timing of a child's laugh, the most random of events, combine like a catalyst with your emotions such that the street never appears quite the same. It is therefore completely plausible, you tell yourself repeatedly, that this is just another daily adventure, that there's no special reason why you turned down this tiny lane rather than the next one. The fact that the White House, the unjustly enticing old, boarded up, cozy, bungalow is just down the street is a mere coincidence, nothing more.

This is not Interactive Fiction. Terribly sorry, but you have to know the truth sometime. 
Well, I hear you asking, is it an Adventure Game? That's trickier. Adventure, yes, certainly, it's all about getting treasures and exploring. A game? Yes... but to a limited degree.


It is my belief that we adventurers are influenced drastically by the thousand, minuscule, random events that occur each day. As they say, a Grue flaps its lips in Quendor and the weather changes in the Eastlands. 
The same occurs on a much more personal scale. Our attitudes can range over a vast spectrum between hope and despair, joy and sadness, treasure and slag, triggered by such inconsequential and unpredictable forces as our 
lantern not working, or a trying to open an ornate egg without the requisite skills. This piece demonstrates that.


This piece tells a story of a person exploring a great, underground empire, but it is never the same twice. 
Random forces, like the ones we face in real adventures, change the story every time it is read. All in all there 
are over 1023 possible stories that can occur. Some are completely different from others, while some stories 
only differ from the rest by a single, crucial paragraph. But the stories are all created by the same, not-quite-
random Random() function.


So where do you, the adventurer come into this? Just as in life, through unpredictable events around us may shape
 our existence, so too does personal choice. In this piece the adventurer is limited to one choice: to continue 
adventuring, or to turn back. Simple as this is, it is the key to the whole adventure, and one that lies 
completely in your hands as the player. You may adventure on, or you may turn back. And when you have reached 
the end of the street you can return to the beginning and see how the story is changed the next time through.


That's basically it as far as interaction. There are some additional commands you can enter. You can't save or 
restore or undo or anything the Inform Libraries would normally let you do (I didn't use any of the libraries).
Also, if you reach a paragraph that you have seen too often or you simply dislike you can type "no" and will be 
offered an alternate interpretation of that moment. For once, you are given the god-like power to refuse reality 
in lieu of something else.


I'd like to extend thanks to my boss for putting my new project on hold, giving me the time to waste to
 make a parody of "Beale Street."
 I actually kind of liked "Beale Street" for what it was. But it wasn't Interactive Fiction by any stretch of the imagination. I still like to think of Interactive Fiction 
as "adventure games" -- I think beating puzzles (good ones anyway) is fun (I even like making maps) -- and after playing "Beale Street," I just couldn't resist the urge to meld today's "cutting edge" IF with a classic adventure game.


Anyway, if anyone is offended, sorry. I was just trying to be funny.

=== gussdeath.z3 (v3) ===
Your looking for a job. 'Boss' as you know him as, picked you up one day and asked you if you wanted one. It was about murder, and you were scared at first, but when he offered you five hundred thousand bucks you told him you would take the risk. The car stopped at about seven o'c, and you got out, the gun's cold metal touching your hip. You began walking, thinking of what you are about to do...

Ramp


You are on the ramp leading down from the starship Heart of Gold to the surface of 
the legendary lost planet of Magrathea
. To the north is the hatchway, and down leads to the Blighted Ground.


Without a word, your friends return to the ship, leaving you (once again) to scout the area without having to do it themselves; and leaving you alone with Marvin - which is as close to no companion as you can get.




You notice a strange twinkling down to the south, whereas you can see a familiar shape up the ramp - to the north. You can go to either of these; they don't lead anywhere helpful.




Marvin, the Paranoid Android, is sulking.

Hatchway


You are at the bottom of a gangway. A hatch below you, which leads out to 
the legendary lost planet of Magrathea
, is open. Another door leads up, but Eddie closed it when you left.




Your gown appears to have been left where you dropped it in the last game (which seems like quite an unlikely occurrence, considering the ship you are currently in is very likely to do unlikely things): in short, your gown is on the floor
.

=== hangar_22.z5 (v5) ===



It is the hottest summer of all time (or at least it feels that way now that your electricity has been cut off). Your lack of employment has finally caught up with you. Your funds have been depleted and your pockets are empty. Last month's essentials (cable television and Internet access) are now but sweet memories. The lack of air conditioning feels like the final straw. You were really hoping to starve to death at a comfortable 68 degrees.

Yesterday for lunch you boiled and ate two hot dog wieners. For dinner, you drank the water you boiled them in. (Mmm, "Hot Dog Soup".) So far your dignity has kept you from rummaging through trash cans for food, but it's starting to sound like a viable option. Just the thought of sinking your teeth into someone else's left over pizza crust makes your mouth water.

The current economy has made it hell for a spoiled, out-of-work computer programmer such as yourself to find work.  It wasn't too long ago that a five-figure salary seemed beneath you; today, given your current state of affairs, you would accept four. It's time to find a job and find some food, and find them today.

Living Room


While your living room isn't much to look at, you call it home. Back when you were working 80 hours a week, you had no time to fix the place up. Now that you have all the time in the world, you have no money. Even in hard times, you retain your sense of irony. Your ratty couch sits along one wall, facing your cheap (and empty) entertainment center. The front door of your home is to the NORTH. Your dining room lies WEST, and your bedroom is to the SOUTH.


(First time playing Hangar 22? Type ABOUT. Need a list of common commands? Type COMMANDS.)




Your front door is closed, which prevents people outside from coming in, and vice versa (it's called physics).



You

a

You look roughly like an out of work computer programmer ... which, coincidentally, is exactly what you are. Your clothes are baggier than normal, thanks to your mandatory recent "low-food-intake" diet. Years of sitting behind computer keyboards have given you lean fingers and a pot belly, but when push comes to shove, you clean up nice.

Before the front gate


Well, you can understand why Uncle Steve certainly doesn't get a lot of visitors.  The path here is little more than a dirt track, with weeds and overgrown bushes crowding it from both sides.  And the view is less than stellar, the museum looming over you keeps bringing to mind words like "gloom" and "doom" and other words ending in "oom".




An ominious looking black iron gate bars the way north.

=== harry.z8 (v8) ===







"All right, we're here! Hogsmeade!" shouts one of the students. You look around in amazement. So this is the wizard town that those third-years on the train were talking about. The place where Sirius hid out, watching over Harry, and where that Rita lady scrounged up all the lies for her Daily Prophet articles. Too bad it's a little too dark for you to see everything, though. Can you believe it? You're almost there! Almost at Hogwarts! The excitement is coursing through your veins!

Deep in the Forest


Perpetually misty and haunted, the forest is a scary place in your mind. In fact, it's also quite disorienting. As you walk in and look at the huge, huge trees with their big trunks and dark wood, you lose all sense of direction and don't even know which way you entered from.




"C'mon everyone," says a gruff voice. "All first years over here, please." You look over and up. And up some more. That must be Hagrid, the huge, scary-looking grizzly groundskeeper, with wild, long, dark hair and a fierce, weathered face. You start to feel slightly afraid, but then you see Hagrid smile a huge smile, shout "Harry!" and run towards a boy with glasses and dark hair, with what looks to be a scar on his forehead, giving him a huge hug. That must be Harry Potter, the boy who survived, who you've heard so much about! What a hero! Standing up to You-Know-Who not just once, but time and time again. Maybe you'll be able to meet him!

Hagrid's Shack


Although this *is* the 21st century, Hagrid's shack would look at home in a medieval feudal farm. Except for the forest closing in from all sides but north and east. With a straw-covered roof and cool, stone walls, it looks like an interesting place!




One of the students, Marvin you think his name is, asks about the cabin to the left. Supposedly, that's where Hagrid lives.

=== hauntings.z8 (v8) ===






"This is the house, miss," the man from the town says, stopping a good few yards from the gate. Even as you thank him, he is walking briskly away - shoulders hunched, hands in pockets - and he does not turn around to answer you. 





 You peer through the wrought-iron curlicues of the gate and wonder if there has been some mistake. This house hardly looks inhabited. All its windows are dark. Its paint, whatever color it once was, has faded to a dull greyish shade. The posts of the porch railing are broken and jagged, leaning at odd angles like a mouthful of crooked teeth. Can this really be the home of your new employer? 





 Well, you should at least go up to the house and look. You've come all this way, after all. 





 You step through the gate. It creaks shut behind you.

Front Lawn


The tall, browning grass rustles in the chill wind, but there don't seem to be any flowers to bring a bit of color to the grey surroundings. A cobbled path cuts a narrow slice through the overgrown lawn, leading north to the house, and another path, branching off of that one, leads around the side of the house to the northwest. To the south looms the front gate.

You have no mirror in which to examine your appearance, but you know how you look: ordinary and a bit drab. No great beauty, you, and the sleepless nights haven't helped. (Of course, Lucy always said you were beautiful. But she would.)

Porch


The old boards of the porch seem to give a little under your feet. To the south, a set of creaking steps leads down to the overgrown, tangled expanse of the lawn; to the north is the front door of the house.

CHAPTER ONE: HAPPY FAMILY


Wet, tired and incredibly bored.

That just about sums up your present frame of mind. Standing in an almost empty churchyard in a ghostly nondescript town, all the while being soaked by constant rainfall, would be bad enough at the best of times.

What makes it even worse is the very fact you're here. An all too often forgotten niece at her uncle's funeral. You're starting to wish you hadn't made the long journey up north after all. It's not like Uncle Henry actually cared about anything except his money and his ego, and you just wish the priest would get on with this tiresome ceremony.

After it's finished you could go home, emptying any lingering thoughts of the selfish, arrogant man from your mind.

Graveyard


Just standing here is enough to give you a shudder. The many gravestones and the ivy covered spire of the church to the north blend in perfectly with the sinister atmosphere. Even the gates to the south, with the promise of relatively safe territory beyond, can't begin to neutralise their gloomy surroundings.




Your uncle's final resting place is marked by a hole in the ground.




A group of mourners are gathered around the latest addition to the cemetery. The parish priest stands nearby, reading the last rites at a painfully slow pace.

The priest pauses for a moment before continuing with his speech.

"There are those of us who are misguided in life, those who seek to inflict pain on others in order to further their own desires. Henry Lambert was one such person."

Your uncle's final resting place is marked by a hole in the ground.




A group of mourners are gathered around the latest addition to the cemetery. The parish priest stands nearby, reading the last rites at a painfully slow pace.



Almost as if in reaction to the priest's condemnation it starts to rain slightly heavier. The crowd of people seems to be growing tired of the sermon and seeing the rapidly declining interest of those present, the priest seeks to bring the proceedings to a swift conclusion.

"May he be forgiven for his sins, and may he find peace and solitude in a better world."

You just came back from work and closed the door, but left the key outside. You have a big bungalow, and you left the key somewhere there. You should try to find it.
 You are standing in the living room of your own house. To the east is the bedroom, and to the north the kitchen.




You can see a table here.


On 
the 
table
 are
 
a 
note
 and 
a 
newspaper
.




The front door is to the west.

Nearly -- nearly. The animal stink is rank and close. You raise your crossbow, try to peer beyond dark, wet stone.

I'm not including hints 
now,
 because this is no longer a Competition game. Different strictures apply. You can easily find a walkthrough, or ask for help. However, I will say this:


No serious mapping is necessary, or even useful, in playing this game. If you think you need to start drawing a map, you're wrong.

"I'm sorry, Mother. I know this isn't the career you wanted for me. But it's something I believe in. I consider it a great opportunity and one I can't pass up."

A silver-haired woman in her later years stands before you with her hands shaking and her eyes in tears. "I know, Jake. I know. You've always made good decisions, and I'm proud of you no matter what. It's just... so very dangerous. I'm worried. Why did you have to sign on with... with..."

You reach out in a feeble attempt to comfort your mother, but the vision fades as it always does in this dream. Never a second opportunity, never another chance to make things right before...

"Breeeeet... Breeeeet... Level 5 Emergency... Level 5 Emergency. Cryogenic pods activated. Hull Temperature now at critical. Guidance System damaged. Main Deflectors destroyed. Descent proceeding on last known trajectory..."

Your hearing is always the first to respond after waking from cryogenic hibernation. A few seconds later the other senses begin to thaw and your eyes regain some level of focus. Normally the first thing you would see is the soft glow of the overhead cabin lights. This time, however, your senses are greeted by unfamiliar and harsh stimuli. The tremendous light and heat, bearing down with the intensity of a hundred suns, don't allow your eyes to open for more than an instant. The grating noise all around you builds to a fevered pitch as it drowns out the automated warnings.

A few seconds later comes a thunderous boom, followed by darkness, and finally silence.

When you regain consciousness you are in possession of the single worst headache you can remember. Granted, this is the 
only
 headache you can remember having. Other than the bump on your head, you can vaguely remember a dream of your mother... and very little else...

Cryotube


You are lying prone on the inside of an all black cylinder. This area is cramped with only a minimum of room to move about. You see a small sensor panel located on the inside of the cylinder. 
Directly above you is a small window set into the frame of the tube. The cryotube is currently closed.

You are dressed in what appears to be a nearly all-black uniform. Black pants, black boots, black belt, and a mostly black shirt with a single thin gray stripe across both sleeves (just above the elbows) and a larger gray stripe around the entire shirt at your midsection.

Welcome to **IDENTITY** - An Interactive Science Fiction Short Story

This is my first published IF work and was created specifically for the 2004 IF Competition. The job of creating an interactive story was a bit more work than I originally imagined. This game took approximately 80 hours of actual code writing with countless more hours reading the IF guides, playing competition entries from the past few years and generally reading up on what has taken place in the IF community in recent years. I grew up with the Infocom games and was pleased to see that the community is alive and well. I'd like to thank the IF community for their help and contributions. I would especially like to thank my beta testers: Chris Cenotti, Jessica Knoch, Vivienne Dunstan and Al. My game grew almost half again in size (not so much in terms of rooms but in terms of interactive objects and extended verbs) thanks to their comments and suggestions. Their efforts in testing are greatly appreciated (though all errors that remain are my own).

If you are stuck, type HINTS to get clues ranging from a gentle nudge to a nearly complete walkthrough. If you want to contact the author regarding this game, feel free to do so at daveber@gis.net. I hope that you enjoyed this adventure and would encourage new authors to enter into the competition for next year!

Post Competition: Well... the IF-Comp has come and gone. Identity placed 15th out of 36 entries. Not bad, but I had hoped to do better. I fixed the known technical issues that were uncovered during the competition - fortunately there were not many. I ended up with a lot of good constructive feedback and will continue to work towards better IF. Thanks to everyone that participated in the review process! The source code to this game can be found at www.ifarchive.org or one of the mirrors.

=== ill.z5 (v5) ===


I didn't take it seriously when the wretched old woman read my fortune and told me I would die on this date. Why should I have? 

Just because she's been right about everything else? 

But it is different now. Because it turns out it's not just me, it's everyone.  Like the banner above the window says: 

WELCOME TO THE END OF THE WORLD. 

The prophecies have come true, one by one.  The earthquakes, the eruptions, the sun turning red. And they've accelerated; the final three all came yesterday, so there is no denying it. Even the most skeptical today are mute, with leaden faces. 

But even in my last hours, or perhaps last minutes, I am not scared. I will occupy my time with activity, for what else is there to do?

Monotrain station


I stand inside the monotrain station, on the balcony beside the window looking out over the city. A train is ready to depart; the conductor hollers out a final call for passengers, but the few remaining people ignore her. The door into the ticket booth is closed, but I can always just go back out of the station.

I study myself, thinking about what it means to be me. I am I, I know. I am this this arrangement of molecules or of brain cells, of thought patterns. If an identical duplicate of me were created, or if that pattern or arrangement were reconstructed in some other medium, would it still be me? Even the pattern that I have is unstable, and changes from one moment to the next, so why could it not be me? But then if there were two of me, could both still be me, or must they not be identical? If the universe one day collapses back down to a singularity and explodes again, and the same arrangement eventually forms, will that also be me? 

Speaking of exact duplicates, the train suddenly explodes in pieces as another train, misrouted, slams into it. I glimpse a huge shard of twisted metal flying my way.

=== inhumane.z5 (v5) ===




You awaken in your tent, lying on the floor, with a hangover like you wouldn't believe. As you lever yourself up, you notice that there is complete silence instead of the usual morning complaints 
of the workers and Roboff's usual shouting. This can only mean one thing - Roboff must have finally run off on you. Panicked, you look around and see your amulet lying on the floor. At least 
Roboff had the sense to not trigger off your alarm. Knowing him, he also had the sense to take the emergency radio. How the megakrip are you going to get out of this one?

In Your Tent


You are in your tent in the encampment. The tent appears to have been completely cleaned out. It is very hot in here and getting hotter. The tent flap to the south is open.


On the ground is the ancient jeweled amulet that you "borrowed" from Mr. Meshugge.

"Is this alright?" asks the young cop. "Do you need the lights lower, or incense, or something?"

"This is fine. I just need to see him, ask some questions."

"Okay," he nods. "Just buzz the buzzer when you're done." He leaves, pulling the metal door to with the click of a magnetic lock. Across the table from you the man stiffens, waiting for you to speak.

Interview Room


The six walls are metal. This is a box in which nothing happens but people talk, and fans whir air in and out to help the words move along. By the door in the north wall is a small red button that rings the buzzer for the guard, and it's smart enough to know who's pushing. This isn't a place people leave of their own accord, and they rarely come here that way either.



The man across the table from you is no different. His eyes are sagging from lack of sleep, and he is sweating just a little even though the air is regulated to be cold.

INSIGHT
 is a standard text-game in many ways. The most important commands are EXAMINE (provide a closer description of something), LOOK (describe the current location), TAKE (to collect an object), and INVENTORY (to list your current possessions). These can be abbreviated X, L, T and I respectively. (eg. "T KETTLE. X KETTLE.")

To talk to characters, you may ASK them about various topics, or type a character's name, a comma and then a question. (eg. MAN, WHY DID YOU MOVE THE BODY?) The game understands quite complicated constructions, but is less prone to error if you keep input simple. Asking the same questions again will often prompt more complete answers; you can also type "PROMPT CHARACTER". "ASK" can be shortened to A.

Movement is via compass directions (N, S, E, W), also Up and Down. You may type RESTART and QUIT at any time; also SAVE will store your current position and RESTORE will reload it. Acknowledgements and credits are in the end-game text. Bugs and feedback to jonnyingold@netscape.net.

=== invisible.z8 (v8) ===






You've always been an outsider. At school, being interested in science, the other students didn't want to have anything to do with you. The other boys laughed at you, the girls despised you. Your parents didn't understand you. And even your teachers were so far below your intellectual level that you couldn't have a serious conversation with them! This went so far that you always got bad grades, although you were smarter than everybody else - your stupid teachers simply never saw it.




Now, after years of restless private scientific research, you've finally achieved your goal: You've found the secret of invisibility. Everyone at work (you don't know any people outside work) said you were mad when you announced your plans... especially your boss who just laughed and said a lowly research assistant working at a second-rate university would never be able to do it. He only hired you to do the most stupid, repetitive and primitive of work, after all. Most of the day, you're forced to clean test tubes. Nobody has ever recognised your genius! Now you've proven them all wrong - and you'll have your revenge on them! Yes, revenge... the only thing you can think of right now. Revenge. Revenge! REVENGE!

Underground Laboratory


Your laboratory (or lair as you sometimes like calling it) has grown to extensive proportions over the years. You're very proud of it, but you've never shown it to anyone. It's a secret, after all. Not that anyone has ever visited you anyway, but if someone had, he or she certainly wouldn't have gotten to see your lab!




You 
can 
see 
a 
computer
, 
a 
whiteboard
, 
a 
workbench
 (on 
which 
are 
a 
test tube
 (in 
which 
is

invisibility potion
)
, 
a 
badge
 and 
a 
pen
)
 and 
a 
wardrobe
 (closed)

You look just like your usual self. In your teenage yours, you decided to drop the common beauty standards and define your own scale - with yourself on top. Although people laughed at you when you announced this, you know perfectly well that all mathematics (and therefore the whole world) is built on arbitrary definitions. So yours isn't less valid than any other.

Your laboratory (or lair as you sometimes like calling it) has grown to extensive proportions over the years. You're very proud of it, but you've never shown it to anyone. It's a secret, after all. Not that anyone has ever visited you anyway, but if someone had, he or she certainly wouldn't have gotten to see your lab!




You 
can 
see 
a 
computer
, 
a 
whiteboard
, 
a 
workbench
 (on 
which 
are 
a 
test tube
 (in 
which 
is 
an 
invisibility potion
)
, 
a 
badge
 and 
a 
pen
)
 and 
a 
wardrobe
 (closed)
 here
.

After the magical wall was erected around the kingdom, the cost of farm labor skyrocketed as workers from the enchanted forest and fairy prairie were no longer able to cross the border to find jobs. You and your mom were squeaking by until she became sick. Unable to afford insurance, you have had to sell off your assets one by one to keep the farm going.




Now you are down to your final cow, good old Bessy.

The Family Farm


Not much is left of the farm, just the tumble down shack you call home and an old stable. The town is off to the west.




Bessy the cow anxiously chews her last wad of cud.

This is a text adventure that I wrote while trying to get my head around ZIL one weekend in 2017.

Thanks to the folks at INFOCOM for ZIL and for that matter the Z-machine, and to Jesse McGrew for bringing ZIL back to life by creating the ZILF authoring tool.

Beta-testing credits: Lara Welch.

At 04:35 hours today Tuesday 4th March, Mission control lost radio contact with Jet-Blue. Shortly thereafter at 04:36, the computer link between Jet-Blue and mission control failed. At 4:40 Long range radar scans showed the space craft enter Yaanek's atmosphere in an uncontrolled descent. No further contact has been made with Jet-Blue's crew, and early assessment indicates that the spacecraft may have broken up in an uncontrolled re-entry.

Fifth Layer of the Earth's Crust


Endless dark and foreboding passages surround you on all sides. You're cold, tired, and that musty smell in the air has really started getting to you lately. Spelunking seemed much more romantic when you first agreed to accept the mission for the Jewel. Untold riches, fame, glory; it seemed so perfect. Now you're a month into the expedition with little to show for it except for a few rock samples and the death of a party member. You're deep inside the fifth layer of the Earth's crust, surrounded by tight shafts and ominous pits. You are quickly descending to the sixth and final layer; the resting place of the fabled Jewel.




Your good friend and fellow campaigner Jacob is here. He slowly scuttles through the underground by your side.

You're tired and sore, but you're surviving. Your hands glow with a soft radiance and you know nothing of hunger thanks to the Amylan Druids' spells.

You can get all the info you need from Jacob at the moment.



A few small rocks tumble down from the ceiling.

You and Jacob find secure handholds and proceed into another dark passage.


A cool gust of wind blows freshly across your face.

=== karn.z5 (v5) ===





A Galactic servant, that's what you feel like at the moment.  You'd think that the Timelords would be pleased that you were not only responsible for discovering that Morbius' brain had been secretly kept alive, but that you were instrumental in destroying the revived villian.  Do they offer you their gratitude?  No, they merely point out that you left the Brain of Morbius on Karn and demand that you retrieve it and bring it back to Gallifrey.  That's gratitude for you.

However, as you value your own freedom, you really don't have much choice but to do as the Timelords request.  At least they gave you the coordinates for Karn, but you did notice that they refused to give you return coordinates for Gallifrey, saying you'd receive them once you'd procured the brain.  So much for Gallifreyan hospitality...

Your thoughts are interrupted as you hear a familiar thud.  The TARDIS has landed on Karn.

How to play "RETURN TO KARN"
----------------------------

COMMANDS AND VOCABULARY:

RETURN TO KARN understands a wide variety of commands.  However it has a limited vocabulary, much smaller than your own.  If you give it a word it doesn't understand, it will tell you so.  Try entering your command again using a different word in place of the one the game objected to.

Your commands should generally be in the format:

<verb> <(multiple) noun phrase(s)> <preposition> <noun phrase/object>

Some (hypothetical) examples of valid commands:

     TAKE THE SONIC SCREWDRIVER
          (also: GET THE SONIC SCREWDRIVER)
     PUT THE TIME RING IN THE LEATHER BAG
     PUT THE LARGE CRYSTAL AND THE TINY CIRCUIT IN THE BOX  
     WEDGE THE LONG POLE UNDER THE TRAPDOOR
     DROP THE TARDIS MANUAL
     READ IT
          ("IT" will refer to the last noun mentioned, e.g.,
                the TARDIS manual)
     EXAMINE THE DEAD DALEK (or X THE DEAD DALEK for short)
     EAT THE CELERY
     PUT THE CELERY ON THE LAPEL
     THROW THE BOMB AT THE SONTAREN
     SHOOT THE YETI WITH THE REVOLVER
     ATTACK HIM
     ("HIM" will refer to last noun mentioned, e.g., the
                yeti)
     TAKE ALL
     (will get everything movable at the current location)
     GET THE KEYS, BOTTLE, FOOD AND THE CLOAK
     PUSH THE RED BUTTON THEN PUSH THE GREEN BUTTON
     UNLOCK THE SLIDING DOOR WITH THE ACCESS KEY
     NORTH (or N)
     WEST (or W)
     SOUTHWEST (or SW)
          ...etc...
     ENTER THE TARDIS
     PUT THE HAT ON THE METAL TABLE
     TURN ON THE FLASHLIGHT
     LIGHT THE CANDLE WITH THE MATCHES
     PULL THE SILVER LEVER
     WEAR THE SILLY HAT (also: PUT ON THE SILLY HAT)
     TAKE OFF THE HAT (also: REMOVE THE HAT)
     DROP THE KEY AND THE BOTTLE

And if you've encountered a living character:

     ASK ADRIC ABOUT THE MISSING CIRCUIT
     TELL DAVROS ABOUT DENTAL HYGIENE
     ROMANA, OPEN THE COMPUTER PANEL
     K9, FOLLOW ME
     SHOW THE TICKLE STICK TO SUTEKH
     GIVE THE LIGHT SPEED OVERDRIVE TO ZOE
     SAY "YES"

Compound commands can be created by connecting single commands (like those above) with "THEN" or the punctuation symbol "." to connect two or more separate commands.

Below are a few examples of valid compound commands:

     TAKE THE THERMAL LANCE THEN PUT IT IN THE TOOLKIT
     PRESS THE GREEN BUTTON.  TURN THE KNOB.

If the game understands all of the words in your command, but still seems confused by the command -- then try to say the same thing using fewer words and a simpler sentence.  When in doubt, simplify your commands as much as possible.  This also saves typing effort.


SPECIAL COMMANDS:

The game uses a number of special commands for various "housekeeping" chores.  These are all pretty standard for most adventure games, specifically:

HELP           Brings up these instructions.
SCORE          Will summarize your progress, so far.
INVENTORY      Will display a list of the items you are
               carrying, and those items you are wearing.
               (also: I)
BRIEF          Will cause location descriptions to be brief.
VERBOSE        Will cause location descriptions to be 
               verbose.

LOOK           Will give you a full (verbose) description of 
               your current location.
SAVE           Will save the current game status on disk.
RESTORE        Will restore a previously saved game from 
               disk.
QUIT           Quits the current game session.  Always exit 
               using QUIT
RESTART        Restarts the game from the very beginning

Overall, just type in simple english phrases (e.g. PUT BATTERY IN COMPARTMENT) and worry about correct phrasing if the game has any difficulty understanding you.

=== kidnapsea.z8 (v8) ===






You've awakened to the waves rocking a small rowboat that you are seated on. The blazing sun hides your view in a white flash for a moment, then you can see.


Your arms are chained to your back, and you can still small the strong drugs that were forced under your breath.


All this happened with a walk down the shore of the beach, now far, when a rough hand pushed a damp napkin against your nose. Before you could react, you remember your eyes flickering shut.


All you saw was pure darkness. Now you need to find a way to escape.




Note: Some new commands....


Talk to (someone)


Think about (a topic)


Ask (someone) about (something)


Chain (something) to (someone) 
(It's similar to tying)

The Sea

The water continues everywhere, moving here and there. Up high, the sun casts a shining light that prevents you from looking up.




In 
the 
boat
 you 
can 
see 
a 
key
, 
a 
chain
, and

Running down a long featureless white corridor not knowing from who or what you experience a great sense of urgency and panic. Dressed in nothing but a white hospital robe, a shudder runs down your spine as you feel thin fingers reaching out to grab you. A voice calls out, "You have one minute to reach minimum safe distance," followed by the distant sound of an explosion.

You round a corner and stop short. Panic rises in your heart as you face a horrible drooling man wielding an axe. Before you can turn to flee he dissolves into another man clad in a white doctor's coat and wearing a stethoscope around his neck. He speaks a word that sounds like, "Spivey."  He suddenly lunges for you! You turn to flee...

No longer in the featureless hallway, you find yourself in some kind of laboratory. The hum of great machinery is all around you. An odd sensation near your head makes you realize that your hair has grown long and stringy. An itchy sensation in your chest catches your attention and you discover that you are no longer wearing the white robe. Instead you are attired in a turtle neck sweater and bell bottoms. A nearby terminal beeps an alarm. Reams of ticker tape begin to spew output onto the floor. The Program some how feels familiar.

A noise from behind you catches your attention. Two men dressed in dark suits and glasses enter the room. An ominous and hunched shadow looms in the doorway behind them lurking on the edge of sight. The sense of fear and urgency returns. The men draw guns from within their coats. You have nowhere to run...


 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
-BANG-


You sit up in your bed. Your eyes refuse to focus on the great commotion about you. Someone calls your name. Someone else has kicked your door in. Three people are in your room and before you can react one of them is on you. He rolls you to the ground and secures your hands behind your back. Your name is called again. The voice is that of your roommate John. The other two figures have bound him with duct tape and are carrying him from the room.

Lightning flashes! You see the ominous shadow of a hunched figure peering in through the panes of your window. A short sharp pain shoots through the back of your head and all goes black and silent...

John And Your's Room
 (on 
the 
floor
)


You share this double room with your good friend John. A window, which has a nice view of the campus arts center and two dressers are the only notable furnishings of the room other than the two identical single beds. A door, hanging from its broken hinges provides passageway between this room and the common room to the south. A small but adequate walk-in closet lies to the east.

A Final Thought.

Day and night I feverishly worked upon the machine, creating both a soul which could desire its goal, and a body with which it could realize it. Many who saw my creation called it an abomination, and denied me grant money. But they could not dissuade me from my impossible task. It was a spectre that tormented me always, a ghost I had to give a form and a life, lest it consume me from the inside. And when at last my task was done, when the grey box on wheels was complete and when it, as well as I, knew what had to be done, I felt deep sympathy for the machine. For I had not destroyed the phantom, but merely exorcized it into another body. The robot knew not why this task had to be performed, for I could not imbue it with knowledge I did not myself posess. And at the same time, I felt a sweeping sense of relief sweep over me, that somehow, the dream that had driven me for my entire life had come one step closer to fruition.

"Gort, Klaatu Verada Nikto"

As I vocally activated the robot, I realized that it was following my instructions, but not out of any desire to obey me. Had I remained silent, it would have performed exactly the same operations. We were two beings controlled by the same force now. And yet, seeking vainly to hold some illusion of control over the machine I thought I had created, I gave my final command.

"GO!"  I told the box as it began to roll out of my workshop into the frozen desert beyond. "FIND KITTEN!"

Your Office


This is a startlingly disorganized office. Beneath the mountains of papers, computer manuals and discarded junk food containers you can barely make out a dented metal desk. The only exit from the clutter is to the east.



You
 can 
see 
a 
computer terminal

You're just another teenager killing time at the Pleasant Ridge Mall, where you've spent way too many quarters on arcade games. The final "closing time" announcement echoed through the halls over an hour ago, but you didn't notice. Too many lives left on your high score run.

By the time you look up, the mall is deserted. The lights are dimmed, the gates pulled down over store entrances. A sudden realization hits you: you've been locked in.



Late Night at the Mall

Around you, rows of arcade cabinets sit dormant; Pac-Man, Asteroids, and Donkey Kong among them. The only light comes from the dim, flickering glow of the Galaga machine in front of you, where your high score blinks triumphantly on the screen
.

A glance south towards the entrance reminds you of the sinking reality: it is blocked by a rolling metal barrier
.

You're just like any other kid at the mall, dressed in casual clothes and carrying a stack of quarters. But now, that stack is gone.

=== leaptime.z8 (v8) ===






Nobody told you stardom would be this boring. You thought the five-year wait just to get into the sky was bad, but at least you had an earth to occupy yourself with, humans doddering around like flies - rather amusing flies. You haven't seen humans on the moon in forever. You've seen nothing, in fact, but the same dull rocks in the same musty craters, and the stars who made it to the sky saying don't worry, it'll be your turn soon, everyone gets their chance, stay pretty, you should really shine more.




You have to admit, though, he was right. Your turn came. A leap second, your time to plunge off this rock into their sky, stop clocks, fulfill a few wishes if you must, and dazzle everyone who watches - that, or miss the landing and live the rest of your life swaddled by a cold ocean. Your debut: all the stars do it.




The sky is cold. Midnight is soon. Leap time.

Moon Crater


Well, it's private, at least. They assured you of this. It's a crumbly gray hole dug into a gray field, yes, and the air's choked with dust. You can't move without kicking up a new cloud and blinding yourself for a few seconds, not that there'd be much to miss. But at least people can't see you here. Even if someone down below were to look at the sky when you were out of your trench, they'd merely see a shiny speck. Windows get them all the time
. Nothing to dwell upon
.

They could have given you more time to prepare. 
The fringe in your hair is all knotted and doesn't resemble clouds or gossamer so much as lint strings.


 Your wings are all wrong; against even the slightest breeze they'd split like tissue
. And your streamers are just sad. Fortunately, humans aren't star connoisseurs.

Moon Crater


Well, it's private, at least. They assured you of this. It's a crumbly gray hole dug into a gray field, yes, and the air's choked with dust. You can't move without kicking up a new cloud and blinding yourself for a few seconds, not that there'd be much to miss. But at least people can't see you here. Even if someone down below were to look at the sky when you were out of your trench, they'd merely see a shiny speck. Windows get them all the time
.

You are a student at Anycollege, in Anytown, and it's the end of the semester!  You've been slacking off all semester long, and it's catching up to you. That final paper is due for your Computer Science class ("The History of IF Games"), and you desperately need to check out a comprehensive book on Graham Nelson, one of the foremost authors of the obscure genre of interactive-fiction. You know there is exactly one such book, but you have no idea where it might be! 

The first time player should probably type "help".

Lobby


This is the entrance to the library. The circulation desk dominates the room, seemingly cobbled together over the course of several generations from an assortment of desks and tables. A pair of security gates stands before the front doors to prevent people from stealing books. A card catalog lurks in a dark and dusty corner of the room, seemingly cringing away from the harsh flourescent light. Glass doors to the west lead to the book stacks; an archway to the northwest is labelled "Duplicating Services"; a door to the north bears a sign marked "Private" in large friendly letters; and the exit is to the east

The search for a job can be arduous for a young person like you, with no experience or contacts and a newcomer to the city. That's why when you had that newspaper in your hands yesterday and read the ad ("young, inexperienced bookstore assistant needed") you didn't hesitate for a second. 

However, now that you are walking down the gloomy streets of the neighbourhood where your future job resides, you wonder if you were not too quick to accept...

Gloomy Street


The houses in this area seem hastily abandoned as if a mysterious tragedy had sown panic among its former inhabitants. All you see are shattered windows and ripped doors. In front of you, to the south, is the strangely well preserved and beautiful library building where you have to work.

The warm summer rain paints a pattern on the vespertine pavements of Rome. I'm in my shower while large drops of rain aggressively knock against the window, just to join with their siblings to form a rill.

I think of 
them
. Each of them was so special. The delicate fingers pressing against the indestructible window pane which was supposed to keep evil out. The superior attitude suddenly giving way to despair. The widening eyes in the moment of cognition. I step out of the shower and let go of the memory. My mouth line is twisted into a bitter smile. My skin is dry.

My towel curves elegantly across the shiny floor tiles from the shower towards the washing stand. 
The latter includes a chrome basin and, above that, a large mirror. A window between the shower and stand offers a view of the street outside. The door leads into the living room.

Bathroom
Sunday, October 5th 1975
Personally, I 
am
 not a huge admirer of my body, but women 
seem
 to like it. My facial features 
are
 edgy, but not in an unpleasant way. I always 
look
 neat, carried with the appropriate demeanour. My biggest strength, if my admirers 
are
 to be believed, 
are
 my enigmatic eyes. Fate 
has
 given me a very slim build, right in line with the current trends.

A Familiar Place
You push the door open. It doesn't creak at all.



White Room


This is a comfortably cluttered room. Cluttered with bookshelves, mostly. To one side is a large desk, on which a computer squats regally.
 A lumpy couch is the only other furniture of note.



Beside the computer
 is
 
a
 
small glass box
.




Resting on the couch, and snoring in a manner which you suspect infringes copyrights owned by several local earthquakes, is a huge genie. Honest.

What was that?


You freeze, all your senses on alert. Not mineral. Not vegetable, either. That means...animal? Your eyes scan the countryside, swiveling like searchlights, and pause briefly on a grove of trees to the north.


"No, not there! Up here!" guides a voice edged with impatience. As you whirl around, peering up, you squint and shield your eyes against the sun's glare. Waving at you from the top of a rickety wooden fence is a well-groomed egg, who confesses, "I could use a bit of help, if you don't mind."


After a long and rather awkward silence, the egg mutters, "It's very rude to stare, you know. When I was your age, children were taught to respect their elders, not gawk at them as if they were animals in a zoo." The egg crosses his legs, folds his arms and pretends to ignore you.

Rickety Fence


The ramshackle wooden fence in front of you seems to lurch from one horizon to the other. 
Although it hasn't fallen over yet, it threatens to at any moment, and if that egg isn't careful...


The footpath running along the fence veers sharply north.




The egg removes a handkerchief from his pocket and polishes a pair of spectacles.

You're seven years old and in trouble a lot. You try to be good and to do as you ought, but nothing, it seems, goes exactly as planned. For instance, today things got quite out of hand: you poured your own milk, but it spilled on the floor; the cat wanted out just as you slammed the door; you didn't remember to turn off the faucet; your brother, poor thing, is still locked in the closet.


But that wasn't all. No, indeed. Did I mention that things got much worse? They did. Pay attention: you're lost and alone and nothing's familiar. You wander around for a while until you're ready to panic. Then, out of the blue, an egg on a fence asks for help--and from you!

Rickety Fence


The ramshackle wooden fence in front of you seems to lurch from one horizon to the other. 
Although it hasn't fallen over yet, it threatens to at any moment, and if that egg isn't careful...


The footpath running along the fence veers sharply north.




The egg hums a little tune your mother used to sing at bedtime.

The Lost Spellmaker
Press space




Another day as an agent of the Sacromys Pemcoangs Secret Service, something that never fails to thrill you. So much for your father's contention that you'd become nothing more than a boring housemaid. But then his masculine pride was probably threatened by the fact that, at three feet two inches, you grew to be a good inch and a half taller than he. But enough of such matters - "T" wants to see you, and it's about a new mission...

Secret Service HQ


Only the best is good enough for the main room of the Secret Service headquarters. The walls are oak-panelled, and covered with photographs of important-looking people; the floor sparkles so much that you suspect it has been enhanced with the aid of a spell; and the equipment is all top-of-the-range, including the Magic Weaver in the corner. The only exit is to the west.



Sitting behind an impressively large desk on a seat far too large for him is your boss, "T". 
He is busy writing and clearly hasn't seen you come in.

Secret Service HQ


Only the best is good enough for the main room of the Secret Service headquarters. The walls are oak-panelled, and covered with photographs of important-looking people; the floor sparkles so much that you suspect it has been enhanced with the aid of a spell; and the equipment is all top-of-the-range, including the Magic Weaver in the corner. The only exit is to the west.



Sitting behind an impressively large desk on a seat far too large for him is your boss, "T". 
He is busy writing and clearly hasn't seen you come in.

=== lucidnight.z5 (v5) ===


Everything here is white. Somehow, you know that, even before you raise your head from your crouched position on the floor. As you cautiously look around, your clearest and most pressing sense is that you feel out of breath and exhilarated - and you're not supposed to feel like that, you're supposed to be resting, you promised you'd rest - but here you are anyway. You're certain you've never seen this place, but it's too familiar for comfort.

You must have been here before.

You are in a white, circular room with the plainest, smoothest walls you can imagine.




A large control wheel is attached to the wall. It's the only thing in here that isn't just a smooth white surface.

Front Of The Office


You are standing outside a medium sized, new-looking office block. Blue glass rises majestically above you, and off to the east and west. To your north is the main entrance. To the south is the main carpark.

Main Entrance


The main entrance to the building is plush and opulent. And locked. The lights are off and the doors are securely locked. Through the toughened glass you can see a half finished cup of coffee (or perhaps tea - no accounting for taste) sitting on the receptionists desk. It looks like someone left in a hurry. The only way out is back south.

=== magic-toyshop.z5 (v5) ===


You were looking for a birthday present for your niece Isabelle, that was it. The toy stores along Regent Street were blaring out pop music and the window displays were garish scenes of animated computer violence. But down a dim Victorian arcade you came across a different kind of toyshop, with a peeling rocking-horse behind a grimy window. Perhaps in here, you thought...

Toyshop


Who knows what might be hidden in the dark rafters and shadowy corners of this emporium?



There's a closed oak chest
 in the 
northeast
 corner.



A young woman 
stands attentively nearby.

You turn to leave, but alarmingly you are unable to find a way out.



Catharine opens the chest and roots around inside it. "I wonder if your niece would like something like this?" she says. "It's quite old, but I think it still works." She closes the chest and shows you a small cardboard box. She holds it up to her ear and shakes it. "Sounds like it's all there. It does require some assembly, though," she adds, and hands the box to you.

=== mansion.z5 (v5) ===




The letter from the solicitor didn't tell you much about the house that you've inherited, other than its location. Now, after a long and tedious journey across some of England's most remote countryside, you've finally arrived. You're surprised by the size of the place; evidently your great aunt was more wealthy than you ever suspected.

As the taxi disappears back the way it came, you take the key from your bag and turn to look at your new home...

In May 2044, the Soviet Union established Krasnyy Zamok, the very first base on Mars. Three years later, after all sorts of technical difficulties, USA established The Freedom Base. And here you are, a farm boy from Idaho, an essential part of the crew. Or at least, that's the story.

The sniveling, weak and simple-minded crypt things that make up the board of deans at Hoover rejected your application with an air of snotty disdain. These aged -- and afraid! -- old men couldn't bear, for a moment, to think outside the box and consider your request to study Unnatural Mystic Phenomenon as completely valid. 

It took almost a month of cajoling, phoning and begging, but you finally got the lot of them together in one room so that you could plead your case in person. You recall how difficult it was, years ago, to get together the required cast for your PhD review at Syracuse, and it only increases the fury and contempt you have for the liverspotted trots before you today.

You will get your approval. You will complete your studies here in the desert, flanked by continually imported human decadence, the comforting warmth of the sun and, of course, easy showgirls. Or else you will be the end of these miserable, cowardly, academic dinosaurs!

East Wing Conference Room


Before you are the department heads to the different University factions you could scare up. Clack, the dean of mathematics; Schmidt, the dean of languages; VanBeaugard, the dean of history; Snell, the dean of sciences and Lee, the dean of religion and mythology. Headmaster Yeboeha is also here, although you don't remember asking for the pleasure of his company. The deans fidget about, probably thinking of just how to phrase the cruel insults they will eventually attack you with.

(Jalen McKeon)
You are a fine specimen of humanity. You have piercing blue eyes and jet-black hair. You are wearing a dark ensemble with a black necktie that prominently displays a single red rose. You also feature a pair of silver-rimmed glasses with a moderate prescription. You are driven by your desire to learn and thirst for answers.

[Warning: Sometimes you may be extremely frustrated and pissed and want a hint without really considering the scene. You may type HINTS OFF at any point and this will disable hints. No, not in the bitchass way that Zork Nemesis does it; this will only disable hints for this session. If you'd still like a hint, indicate HINT.]

You can't go that way.



Suddenly, the door leading out of the Hall opens. An absolutely gorgeous young woman -- surely no older than nineteen -- dressed in a provocative cocktail dress enters the room pushing a large cart. Atop the cart is a covered silver pan.

"Happy Birthday!" she exclaims. She comes up to Clack and gives his geezergenarian cheek a wet kiss. Everyone except Lee and yourself clap and hoot. The girl removes the top of the pan revealing a large chocolate and vanilla birthday cake.

The girl cuts the cake up into several smaller squares. She deftly maneuvers her body away from that of Clack who is apparently attempting to pinch her behind, to the delight of the rest of the deans (again, excepting Lee).

=== medusa.z5 (v5) ===






It took you a little time to get your vampire costume together, so you've been running late for Gary's costume party.  You've arrived now on the ground floor of his high-rise apartment building.  Better late than never as they say.  

The elevator makes a soft jingle as it opens and you step into the mirrored interior.  For a moment you think, struggling to remember Gary's floor number...  Oh yes, you remember now, 
15
.  You reach out and push the appropriate button.  The doors begin to close but stop suddenly as a slender hand appears.  There's another jingle and the doors open again revealing a beautiful, red-headed girl dressed in a toga.  

You recognize her from campus although you do not actually know her.  For a moment you almost do not see the red rubber snakes entwined with her long red curls.  She steps into the elevator and reaches for a button, but stops, apparently seeing that it is already lit.  


It seems,
 you think as the doors close and the elevator begins to move, 
that this "Medusa" is going to same costume party that you are.

Elevator


An elevator; pretty much like any other elevator you've ever been in. Your increased weight conveys the sensation of movement and the floor indicator above the closed doors changes as the elevator passes floors. Next to the elevator doors, several dozen buttons are arranged in two rows.

All the walls in this elevator are mirrored and exhibit a matrix of identical vampires and gorgons stretching to infinity in all directions.




A slender, red headed girl dressed as Medusa stands beside you.  Her reflections surround you in all directions.

Just you, all dressed up in the Dracula costume your brother helped to make.




The girl smiles at you. "I've always been fascinated with Greek mythology." She glances at her reflection in the mirror. "My room mate helped me make this.  She's a theatrical major and gets a lot of experience working with costumes.  I understand her professor is a little on the cheap side so they often just have to make do."

That rings true to your ears, having taken some creative arts classes before.

=== metamorp.z5 (v5) ===




You wake to stillness.  The hammering, banging, and shouting that kept you awake half the night are gone.  The air is cold, and something smells burnt.  Your master's experiments must be finished, but with what result?

Something hesitates on the edge of your consciousness, the memory of unquiet dreams...


Then you see.  You have been sent, again.  The taste of ash is on your lips, the grit in your eyes.  And you blink...

Bare Room


A formless place, such as you have often seen before; where dreams end and tasks begin.  The floor is uneven, cupped like the palm of your master's hand.   
The walls shimmer with the artifice of your sending.




A loose rock lies near your foot.

This is not, I think, a difficult game: almost all puzzles have more than one solution.  It is possible to put the game into an unwinnable state, but not particularly likely unless you go out of your way.

This game is a revised version of the one which was submitted to, and placed 2nd in, IF Competition 2000.  It is not to be sold to anyone, nor incorporated onto any compilation, without the specific permission of the author.

=== mhpquest.z5 (v5) ===


Your daughter Crystal has recently become ill, but you do not know why. It is obvious to you that if she isn't cured soon she will die. You have heard stories about a magical plant which grows somewhere around this region, but you have never actually seen it. It is said to be able to cure any illness. You must set off to find it. It is your only chance to save your daughter. 

Good luck!

Small Cottage


This is your home. A small cottage that you built for you and your daughter. Made from the wood of the surrounding trees, it blends in very well with the surroundings. The room is not well furnished. There is just a table, an old stove and two beds. In one of the beds lies your daughter, Crystal. Set in the south wall of the cottage is a small square window. 

 Exits: Exit.




Your daughter Crystal is here lying on her bed.

=== mimesis.z5 (v5) ===





Pain.  Unceasing pain.  Ever since your lover Black left, something to do with a mysterious stranger and a time machine, your days have been a dull blur of gray loneliness.  Perhaps you'd feel better if you got out and did something.

Living Room


This is the living room of your rather squalid apartment. The huge compass rose on your floor reminds you that your bedroom is west, the front hall is north, the kitchen is east, and the bathroom is south.




Your mimesis plant squats in its pot in a corner of the room, slowly photosynthesizing.

Front Hall


This is the front hall; a door north leads outside, and the living room is to the south.




A devil, looking for all the world like a cross between the BSD Unix devil and Bill Gates, slouches insolently in the corner.




The door is closed.

[Press any key to begin]


The Kaden finally realized you were spying and locked your mind essence in a digital cell. Normally the Kaden would already be at work analyzing your mind to run the loyalty transfer program, but you haven't felt anything at all in the last five hours. The delay is unnerving, since the mind can survive in virtual space for a limited amount of time before it destroys itself. Your companions, the Souden, should be close to beginning the assault now, although since they know nothing of your predicament survival is still doubtful.

Containment Grid


The design of virtual space can be almost anything, but in this case the room is merely a small cube surrounded by an electric fence, with lines of blue against black crossing the floor and ceiling. A large square door is inset into the floor, slightly off the center, sending the design of the entire room into asymmetrical confusion.

Mines


Copyright (c) 1979, 2005-2009 James L. Dean


Version 2010.10.29 released October 29, 2010


This z-machine program may be distributed or used without payment to its author. Derivative works must credit its author.


"Mines" lets you explore mines. The mine you explore is determined by a mine number specified at the beginning of a game.


The object of a game is to visit all of the rooms and return all of the treasures to the entrance without making too many moves.


In a mine, the passages are straight. So, for example, if you go North to leave a room, you can go South to reenter 
it. The rooms are not evenly spaced. However, the distance between adjacent rooms is always a multiple of the minimum 
distance between adjacent rooms.


Commands in the game are "N", "E", "S", "W", "U", and "D" to move North, East, 
South, West, Up, or Down, respectively. Other commands are "C" to carry 
things, "I" to inventory what you are carrying, "L" to leave treasures, "P" to 
get the points you've scored, "O" for help getting out of the mine, "H" for 
help, and "Q" to quit.


Mine Number? 


You're in the entrance to the mine.



There is a passage

"Mines" lets you explore mines. The mine you explore is determined by a mine number specified at the beginning of a game.


The object of a game is to visit all of the rooms and return all of the treasures to the entrance without making too many moves.


In a mine, the passages are straight. So, for example, if you go North to leave a room, you can go South to reenter 
it. The rooms are not evenly spaced. However, the distance between adjacent rooms is always a multiple of the minimum 
distance between adjacent rooms.


Commands in the game are "N", "E", "S", "W", "U", and "D" to move North, East, 
South, West, Up, or Down, respectively. Other commands are "C" to carry 
things, "I" to inventory what you are carrying, "L" to leave treasures, "P" to 
get the points you've scored, "O" for help getting out of the mine, "H" for 
help, and "Q" to quit.

You haven't seen your brother Malcolm since he received his fellowship at Biblioll College - pressure of work was his excuse not to come down to London. So when you received that telegram from him you leapt at the excuse to come up to the university town of Christminster for the day and visit him.

Chapel Street


It is a hot summer's day in Christminster, the kind of day that makes you think of strawberries and cream and punting on the river. The 
morning
 sunlight
 beams down on the cobbles and on the great wooden gate of Biblioll College to the east.




The gate is closed.

=== moonglow.z3 (v3) ===
You awake to a thunderous boom. Looking out your window
you see what appears to be the moon - full and bright.
Only the calendar shows a new moon cycle. This is something
else... And soon you realize that the "moon" is drifting.
Falling, in fact, rather quickly and this ball of light
crash lands in your field. You head out just as dawn breaks.

=== mr-p.z5 (v5) ===




You wake up. A routine look at the alarm clock reveals the time; in five minutes, it would have gone off, but as usual, you didn't even need it. As you won't become more awake, you turn it off.


The Story of Mr. P.

Bedroom
 (on 
the 
bed
)


Here you spend your sleeping hours. 
Margaret
 was, just like for the rest of the house, responsible for decorating and arranging the room when you moved in. Without a doubt, she did this with her very own eye for detail. Once or twice, she hinted that you have been insufficiently appreciative of this. Maybe, but you do recognize the things of real practical value, like the calendar on the wall, at least!

Next to the bed, there is a nightstand. You can enter the living room from here. Because you are not using the second door, located opposite to the window, you have decided to place the wardrobe right in front of it
.




On the nightstand, you can see your wallet.

The Story of Mr. P.
 was written by Hannes Schüller in 2013. Originally published in German language under the title 
Die Geschichte des Herrn P.
, it was adapted into English in early 2014. This English release 2 is technically equivalent with the German release 4. The author loves receiving all kinds of feedback and game transcripts at hannes (at) yllr.net.

Particular thanks go out to Martin Barth and Martin Oehm who were there for advice and tests all through the development phases. In addition, Michael Baltes, Colin Djukic, Marius Müller and Mischa Magyar tested the beta versions - thank you as well! This English version comes to you thanks to Brian Cowell, Andrew Schultz and Jerry Ford, all of whom tirelessly waded through my attempts at finding adequate translations of the original texts and offered many helpful corrections and suggestions.

About this version


This version was coded from Mr. Cree's AGT port of C.E. Forman's original MST3K game, "Detective".




I originally played the game "Detective", and stopped VERY quickly in disgust. Matt Barringer's (only) work of IF stank to high Heaven. Then I stumbled across Mr. Cree's port of Mr. Forman's version of "Detective", using characters from an American TV show ('Mystery Science Theatre 3000'). I loved it! Better, it came with the source code.

MYSTERY SCIENCE THEATRE 3000, Adventure 101, Reel 1.




In a not too distant future, way down in Deep 13, Dr. Forrester and TV's Frank were hatching an evil scheme. They hired a temp by the name of Mike, just a regular Joe they didn't like. Their experiment needed a good test case, so they bonked him on the noggin and they shot him into space.




"We'll send him cheesy movies, the worst we can find." (La la la)
"He'll have to sit and watch them all, and we'll monitor his mind." (La la la)
Now keep in mind Mike can't control when the movies begin or end. (La la la)
He'll try to keep his sanity with the help of his robot friends.

If you're wondering how he eats and breathes, and other science facts... (La la la)
Then repeat to yourself "it's just a show, I should really just relax, for Mystery Science Theatre 3000."

MYSTERY SCIENCE THEATRE 3000, Adventure 102, Reel 1.




In a not too distant future, next Sunday A.D., there was a guy named Joel, not too different from you or me.


He worked at Gizmonic Institute, just another face in a red jumpsuit.


He did a good job cleaning up the place, but his bosses didn't like him so they shot him into space.




"We'll send him cheesy movies, the worst we can find." (La la la)


"He'll have to sit and watch them all, and we'll monitor his mind." (La la la)


Now keep in mind Joel can't control when the movies begin or end, (La la la)


because he used those special parts to make his robot friends.




Robot Roll Call:


Cambot (pan left)


GYPSY: 
Hi, girl



TOM:  
What a cool guy



CROW: 
Wisecracker







If you're wondering how he eats and breathes, and other science facts... (La la la)


Then repeat to yourself "it's just a show, I should really just relax, for Mystery Science Theater 3000."

Coffee House


It's almost evening. You are sitting near the window in a small coffee house, two blocks away from your house. It's a bit dim inside.




There is a teenage girl at one of the tables.




And at the table opposite hers, sitting an albino boy.

The late summer of 1886 found me on the continent for the purpose of regaining my health and spirits. These had been in decline for the past few months, and it was Dr Thorne's suggestion that the best cure for me might be a change of scenery. A short stay in Ramsgate, perhaps. Or better yet, a visit to the Alps in France or Switzerland, where the fresh mountain air would do me no end of good. 

I had declined at first to do any such thing. I was, after all, a staid, solid clergyman of 59 years, mature enough to weather any foolish fluctuations of temper. Besides which, these frivolities cost money. 

The doctor's recommendation eventually reached the ears of my dear sister Emma, however, and she immediately took up the task of convincing me of the necessity of such a trip. But it was not until I obtained news about relatively inexpensive alpine destinations that I relented, and found myself packed off to the continent for a month. 

The month's sojourn improved my health tremendously. However, without the distraction of my usual work, I found the mountains did little to raise my spirits. And so I made my journey homeward in a state of mute distraction, even as the first brilliance of Autumn began to make itself known among the trees. 

All in all, it had been a smooth and uneventful trip, but for a slight pause at the channel. This was at a small French coastal village from which I chose to make my crossing, it being less expensive than the usual ferry at Calais. Here I stopped for a meal at the local inn, and then waited as my trunk was transferred from the train to pier where the boatman was waiting. 

It was only a minor pause....

Pier


The pier stretched out into the cold waters of the English Channel from the village east of here. Overhead, I could hear the gulls swoop and cry. The brisk seaside air 
blew in my face, carrying with it the scent of salt. Far away, across the waves, the white cliffs of Dover could barely be seen in the grey clouded light.



My trusty old steamer trunk lay here.



A fishing boat was moored beside the pier and its boatman was waiting.

Rev Stephen Dawson, vicar of St Swithin's in the diocese of Barchester. I was 59, an Anglican clergyman and a confirmed bachelor. I wore my clerical collar out of both duty and habit, and my hair and whiskers were grey with respectability. My clothes were old and my cuffs were frayed, but as I so often told my sister Emma, sometimes the old things are by far the best.

Pier


The pier stretched out into the cold waters of the English Channel from the village east of here. Overhead, I could hear the gulls swoop and cry. The brisk seaside air 
blew in my face, carrying with it the scent of salt. Far away, across the waves, the white cliffs of Dover could barely be seen in the grey clouded light.



My trusty old steamer trunk lay here.



A fishing boat was moored beside the pier and its boatman was waiting.

=== mystery-of-winchester-high.z5 (v5) ===


Frederick H Winchester III was a rich man who lived in the city of Dunedin in New Zealand. Winchester's grandfather was an Englishman who emigrated to New Zealand in the early 1800s and became very wealthy as an importer/exporter. The grandfather's business was passed down the family line to Winchester's father, then to Winchester himself, along with the company's wealth.

Winchester's wife was Scottish, as were most of the immigrants in Dunedin, but she died of consumption (known nowadays as tuberculosis) at an early age, and the couple never had any children. Winchester never remarried and regretted having no children of his own. As a consequence, when he retired, he became a philanthropist and donated thousands of pounds to children's charities, particularly those that supported the education of Maori children, as he had great admiration for the Maori people and their culture.

Frederick H Winchester III died on 30 April 1932. His mansion was willed to the city of Dunedin to be turned into a high school. The school was named Winchester High in honour of its benefactor. Apart from the mansion, the remainder of Winchester's vast fortune was never found and its whereabouts became known as The Mystery of Winchester High.

Years have passed and the school is now running into financial difficulties. If the school's principal cannot obtain funding, she will have to close the school.

As a student at the school, you didn't really care about the school closing, until your teacher happened to mention that all the students will be transferred to a worse school if funding is not found. With that revelation, you decide to solve the mystery and find Winchester's lost fortune.

It's rumoured that when the mansion was converted into a school, some parts of the former mansion were not used. You wonder whether the fortune could be found there...


[You're about to embark on an adventure. You can move around, examine things and manipulate things by typing simple text commands of one or more words, usually starting with a verb. The tutorial will offer suggestions to get you started. Commands in the tutorial are shown in upper case, but you can enter them in lower case, if you prefer. You can turn the tutorial off by typing TUTORIAL OFF and turn it back on by typing TUTORIAL ON. Good luck.]

Classroom


Your teacher is standing in front of the blackboard at the front of the classroom, while you're sitting at your desk at the back of the classroom. You're feeling fidgety and itching to get out of here to go exploring or play some rugby. The door leading south out of the class is temptingly close.



You can 
see 
a 
blackboard
, 
your
 
teacher
, 
some 
students
, 
a 
framed certificate on the wall
 and 
your
 
desk
 (on which 
are 
an
 
exercise book
 and 
a 
fountain pen
)
 here.


[The description above tells you where you are and what you can see. The '>' below is the prompt. You type commands after the prompt. When the location description scrolls off the screen, you can refresh it by typing LOOK (or L). Try it now. Type L after the prompt.]

Tell me what to do using simple commands starting with a verb.

Use LOOK (or L) to refresh the location description. Identify all the objects in the description and EXAMINE (or X) each one. Read responses carefully for hints.

Use compass directions (N, S, E, W, U and D) to move around. Draw a map as you go.

Use GET or TAKE to take objects and DROP to drop them again. Use INVENTORY (or I) to see what you're carrying.

Use WEAR to wear things like clothing and REMOVE to remove anything that's currently worn.

Use AGAIN (or G) to repeat the last command.


Use UNDO to undo the last command if you make a mistake.


Use SAVE to save the game and RESTORE to restore it again. Use QUIT to end the game or RESTART to restart from the beginning.

There are over 100 verbs that you can use, so if something doesn't work, try a different verb or a different way of doing things. Use HINT if you get stuck.

=== night.z5 (v5) ===





This isn't happening, it really isn't.  You were just about to finish up a two week probationary period as a site operator at the University computer center on the third floor of Hodges Hall.  It was a quiet night, you were working on that interactive fiction game, nobody around...and then you saw a shadow out of the corner of your eye.  And one of the laser printers is gone.  Unless it's back before 7am, this job - the one you were 
counting on 
to pay your tuition next semester - is, shall we say, history.  You sigh.  It's not going to be just another...

Computer Site



This is the computer site.  You know, half a dozen PCs, couple of Macs, a printer table, the desk at which you write that interactive fiction game instead of study.  
An internet router hums quietly in the corner.


The door is northeast.

Computer Site



This is the computer site.  You know, half a dozen PCs, couple of Macs, a printer table, the desk at which you write that interactive fiction game instead of study.  
An internet router hums quietly in the corner.


The door is northeast.

  In this short sample game, you are exploring your great uncle's house. He was a treasure hunter, and you entered in hopes of finding some of his valuables. Unfortunately, the house is very old; the lounge door jammed shut unexpectedly....

Hallway


  This north-south passage is dimly lit. The hardwood floor creaks wearily with age. Backed against the west wall is a small coffee table. Your great uncle's old bedroom lies to the north, and the south archway leads to the lounge.

=== njag.z5 (v5) ===




It is time for your weekly Go lesson. You have been coming to your teacher's home for the past six months and though she isn't extravagant with her praise, you feel that your game is improving. 

Smiling inwardly, you remember your teacher's words the last time you called Go a 'game'. "A 'game'!" she said. "Go is not just a game - it is a reflection of your inner self!" 

But you sense that something is wrong: your teacher doesn't answer your knock, and in fact the front door is unlocked. Curious, you step inside...

Living Room


The living room is tastefully decorated. The furniture is arranged to make maximum use of the limited space. A bookshelf 
takes up one wall, while a sofa and end table are pushed up against another. Directly across from the sofa is a television.

On your last visit, a large wooden Go board occupied the space between the sofa and the TV, but now it's missing. The only thing left in its place are a pair of wooden Go bowls.

The front door is to the north, the kitchen is east and the bedroom lies to the south.

=== northnorth.z8 (v8) ===






Gillivray is on a rant again. His anger, like an icicle of acid, rotates around his place at the head of the boardroom table. It burns Atkins, to your right, who "apparently forgot to evolve from the apes," then swings mercifully past you, to smite Carter, to your left, who isn't even "up to the level of apes, that antediluvian amoeba!"

Gillivray's attention swings back to the middle to focus on you. So he didn't forget you after all: "And you, Norton, you're a man, by species at least. Which makes your manifold failures all the more despicable! Would you like to know the very definition of a shit-eating grin? Look in a mirror, Norton. Furthermore--"

There is no mirror. But, with an inward glance, at this moment of overwhelming stress, thought twists, buckles. Decades of mental training slough away. You do see something, behind your fixed grin. There's that caustic crystal in your skull: the dire compulsion of the family curse. For the last century, once the curse is activated, where it commands, your family must obey: GO NORTH.

You've been lucky your whole life, but no longer.

Boardroom


A high-ceilinged cell of pale polished birch. Hanging on either side of the room are portraits of the Walsingham brothers; Robert, with a dot-eyed face that glistens like polished agate, and pale, rough-skinned Alfred, whose eyes in contrast shine like lamps that seep hypnotic poison.

The oval table is crowded with all the senior employees; foam-flecked Gillivray at the head, and moving clockwise, Mockerby, Shardlow, Ferne, Williams, Ford, Atkins, you (Norton), Carter, Patson, Ripon, Goodenough, and Clevars.

A large doorway heads south into main lobby. A small door leads east to a washroom. A smaller back door, to the north, leads outside.

"HERE BE DRAGONS" is what the rutter said, but the small island turned out to be free of those animals after all. Instead, you landed near a tiny village full of friendly natives.

Aaah, shore leave! You can't remember when the last time was you could relax, take a night off and stroll through town to pick up a girl or two. It turned out your friend Aten speaks a dialect not unlike that of the villagers, and so he joined your captain, who's with the village elder at the moment.

"Too bad for him," you think, grinning, "guess he won't be getting any tonight."

You, on the other hand, are intent to.

Village Center


The center of this small village is a roughly circular clearing in the jungle-forest that covers most of this island. A gigantic tree stands in the middle, reaching hundreds of feet up into the cool night air. The huts of the villagers are strewn around the clearing's border, close to the jungle.
A large stone circle contains charred wood from 
last night's
 bonfire, and there is a rickety wooden platform under one of the lower branches of the tree.

"Hello," you say, somewhat sheepishly. She smiles at you and reaches for your hand, gently pulling you towards what seems to be her hut.

There's nothing to do, and you're sort of tired, so you lay on your bed and think philosophical thoughts.

You wake up with a horrible headache.  As you glance around, you realize that you are not in Kansas anymore.
You attempt to gain some bearing as to where you are...

The OKAY button is blinking again.




Its ridiculously bright yellow light makes everyone in the room appear to be suffering from inttermittent jaundice.  Fortunately you're the only one in the room, because there's no room in here for anyone else.  The OKAY button is also buzzing, with the patented Elevated Responsiveness Tone guaranteed to remain irritating no matter how often one is forced to hear it.  Somehow the most annoying part, though, is that the blinking and the buzzing are slightly out of sync.

HELP is available.




Your "station" is a solid metal enclosure just barely large enough to accommodate your chair and yourself.  On the wall in front of you are the many brightly-colored controls of the security console and a black-and-white monitor.




On the monitor you can see 
Engineer Ghee performing calisthenics in the engine room.  Presumably the machinery is operating normally.

Beginners should type INTRO for a brief explanation of interactive fiction and suggested commands.  "Orevore Courier" is officially "cruel" because you can easily reach a state where the story is no longer WINNABLE.  The adventure is not very lengthy, however, so retracing one's steps should not be difficult.  You may need to do so several times before you understand what's going on in each of the ship's several rooms.  A map of the ship and a diagram of your console are available as separate image files.  For some advice related to the current situation, type HINT (repeatedly if you require a more specific clue).  It would spoil the story's SECRETS to reveal all of its plot points, but you may do so if you wish.  As a last resort, a complete WALKTHROUGH is available.  Please read the CREDITS for words of thanks from the author.  (Capitalized words and phrases are meant to be typed as commands.)

While you've come to think of the direction your feet face as "down", it's really just the direction of the ship's engines.  For this part of the journey, that's the direction of your destination.  You'll be constantly decelerating at 1G until you reach Covetous.  At any rate, all directions have long since become irrelevant until you once again enjoy freedom of movement in a world significantly larger than this security station.

1899: You have decided to spend this year's summer vacation in London again. In spite of the unfortunate events which took place when you went there the first time a couple of years ago, you really liked the place. So you boarded the Orient Express in Or
ș
ova, prepared to take along sleep until your arrival in Paris.




You awake - startled. You're feeling incredibly hungry. It is this deep hunger reaching all the way into the deepest depths of your soul, but which no mortal will ever know. Is it possible that you've reached Paris already? Time to investigate!

You decide to open your coffin first.




Luggage Van
 (in 
the 
coffin
)


Since you have been loaded onto the train already inside your coffin, you have not seen the inside of this van before today. Its practical, unimpressive wooden interior is mostly concealed by crates stacked on top of each other. One particularly large crate is standing upright in one corner. A back door leads east, to the west, you can go deeper into the train.

=== orion.z5 (v5) ===



Lying in the darkness, feeling something wet and slimy on my back, I see a shaft of moonlight piercing down from somewhere above. I see her face, her innocent face, looking at me, and I hear her utter those two words...


And then it all fades away, the fog comes rolling over my memory like a morning on Tantus 7. I try to get up, but my surroundings sway as my head pounds. Finally, it all settles down just enough, and I try to take stock of my situation.

Bottom of a Hole


I am at the bottom of a very deep hole, ankle deep in mud and sludge. I can see the top of the hole several hundred feet above me, which appears to be the only exit.

This game is 
©
2007 David Hughes.

It's probably for the best (or worst?) that you gave money to a begging gypsy that one time, because now, you can travel between this realm a somewhat identical, parallel realm by saying "up" or "down." You're just that gifted, kid.  You've seen some strange things in the other world--your friends replaced with monsters, your things replaced with, uh, other things, and other strange ideas. You tried to tell this to your family, but they didn't believe you. Big mistake, my friend.

Now you're in a psych ward. You'd do anything to get out of this hellhole. Even the family that put you in wants you back - but the doctors keep diagnosing problems you know you don't have. The good news is that Maggie, the supervising nurse, won't notice you unless you go past her desk. The bad news is, well, you're not out yet.

But tonight is when you decided to make your getaway. Tomorrow's your big medical evaluation, and none other than Maggie, who's called you an "aggravating spider" just yesterday, is representing you. Why would you not escape?

Bedroom


Maggie has called lights-out for the evening. The window lets in a small amount of pink light from a gas station sign outside. You're in your green-walled bedroom in one of the wings of the psych ward, with an exit to the North.




The teddy bear you brought from home is sitting in a dull, dusty trance on the nightstand.

Main Hallway


The walls are a different shade of green, but still green. There are visible exits to the West - to the West hallway, and East - to Maggie's desk. Sitting in a corner of the main hallway is an action figure.

There appears to have been a green door leading to the front desk, but only the frame remains.




There is also some kid's sculpture made in arts and crafts here.

=== pentari.z5 (v5) ===



A beautiful day in Bostwin! You are awakened by a ray of sunlight peeking through a window shade and rise refreshed after a restful night's sleep.  You've given your Company a weekend pass to get some R&R after your last grueling mission.  Wasting precious little time your entire company took off for the city proper to pack in as much drinking, carousing, brawling, wenching and other relaxing pursuits as possible in 48 hours.  In the fields of battle your men are an elite unit of trained professionals.  Off-duty they're pretty much like every other bunch of soldiers you've ever served with. 

A weekend off and what to do? After the challenges of the past year when you were first promoted and assumed command of Charlie Company you've nearly forgotton what free time is and what you're supposed to do with it.

Your Quarters


Rank certainly does have its privileges.  When you were a lowly lieutenant you had to share cramped quarters with a fellow lieutenant at your previous assignment.  Commanding a company of your own affords you the luxury of private, spacious quarters just outside the barracks themselves. As a further abuse of your power your chest and bunk are not standard issue items from the Pentari millitary supply center.

Welcome to Pentari!

If you've ever played an adventure game before then you should be right
at home here.  In case you're not here are some guidelines for playing:

1) Don't look for any graphics.  This is interactive fiction.  Fine books
don't have pictures to accompany the text and neither does this game.
Read the screen carefully.  It will contain a description of where
you are, items which may (or may not) be of use to you and in most
cases the other directions you can go which lead to other parts of
the game.

2) Try to keep it simple.  You don't have to, but try.  This game is
written in Inform by Graham Nelson.  It is quite sophisticated to 
recognize anything reasonable which may, in some form or fashion,
have relevance to the game.

3) Save your game often! You'll probably goof somewhere along the way
and saving your game will allow you to restore back to your previous
position.  If you don't save your games with some degree of frequency
you run the risk of having to start all over again from the beginning.

4) Some commands you should be aware of:

save - Save or 'bookmark' your position in the game at the time of saving. 

restore - Load in the last game saved or resume where you are bookmarked. 

restart - Will restart your game from the beginning. 

quit - Abbreviated as q.  Will quit the game when you say so. 

undo - If you goofed somewhere, this will undo your last turn. 

score - Shows your progress in the game so far. 

n,s,e,w - The 4 primary directions.  these will navigate you through
the game.  In addition, ne, se, sw, nw, up, down, in or out
are also good to remember.

again - Abbreviated as g.  This will repeat the last command entered. 

examine - Abbreviated as x.  This is useful to take a closer look
at something such as: EXAMINE THE SCROLL 

look - Will give you a description of the room you are currently in. 

take <item> - Will take an object that is present in the room you are in. 

drop <item> - Will drop an item you are carrying. 

info - Will give you basic information about the game and the author. 

oops <word> - If you made a typo, you can immediately type oops and
the correct word.  Pentari will make the correction for
you, saving you some typing. 

ask <person> about <item> - You should interact with characters in
in the game whenever possible to glean
useful information.

<person>,<statement> - You can talk to characters in the game.  Just
address them by their name followed by what
you'd like to say such as:

> Johnny, Hello

look up <topic> in <book> - Sometimes you may find it useful to do some
research on a given game topic in some
reference material which may present itself.

There are ALOT of other commands which are way too numerous to list. Just try any reasonable verb to do any given thing.  If the game won't accept one way another one will usually always works.

5) Enjoy! Interactive Fiction is a lost art and I hope you truly enjoy
it! Visit my web page at http://users.erols.com/lordrandom/if.htm
for more about interactive fiction and my future releases.

Charlie Company Compound


Your company compound consists of three large buildings bordering a large, open area where company formations precede the orders of the day.  To the west the Company's supply building can be seen while directly ahead of you lies your company's barracks which seem quieter than a crypt.  Off to the east you hear the distant shouts of another Company drilling.  Poor souls.

Your Cubicle


Vast piles of junk fill every corner of this cramped cubicle, but you're only interested in one thing: the report.

Somewhere to the east, behind a particularly immense pile of old papers, is the exit.

Tasteful pastels and neons form a concrete square around an anomalous growth in the form of a large tree. The odd walls and spires surrounding give the impression of exits in many directions.




A chest has somehow managed to lodge itself in the tree's upper branches.

Hello?









Is anybody there?

Hey - I can see you!





You have no idea how long I've been waiting here for something to happen. You see, I appear to be frozen in place. I'm an interesting guy, but the sound of my own thoughts can get pretty tedious after a while.

Hang on - what's that back there? Piece of Mind, huh? I wrote the copy for that sucker. I was playing around with the beta just recently. So it's released now? Man, I must have been here for ages. Last thing I remember was this weird dream. Lemme see if I can show you.  

Lost in the Fog.



A strange phosphorescent smoke covered the area, catching several hues from an unknown light source. A charge was in the air, as if lightning were about to strike. The hairs on the back of my neck were erect. I had this terrible feeling that at any moment someone would wander up and ask me to dance.

Piracy 2.0 - A Text Adventure in Space


by Sean Huxter 


Your shift began like most others as Captain of the United Worlds Guardian Class Patrol vessel, U.W.S. Ceres, a routine supply mission of no particular import, routine crew checks, signing this order, monitoring that communication, so it was not only a surprise, but an unexpected honor when your mentor, Admiral Copeland, contacted you by secure sub-etha channel to charge you with a highly sensitive mission. 

James Whitehall, perhaps this era's most renowned and reviled interstellar pirate, was cornered with his crew and captured yesterday out on the galactic rim, and he wasn't taken quietly. Though when the moment approached, Whitehall's crew bailed and fled in their tattered ship, abandoning their leader to the law. Under heavy guard, Whitehall was transported to the U.W.S. Orion, another Guardian Class ship, which was heavily damaged in the arrest operation. The Orion had to undergo immediate drydock repairs, but it was the only spaceworthy ship in the vicinity. 

Your mission was to rendezvous with the Orion and take charge of this deadly prisoner, allowing the Orion to get back to spacedock without further delay. 

The route you were instructed to take was a coded, randomly-generated series of course corrections which would have sent anyone trying to intercept you on a wild goose chase, as you were eventually to arrive and dock at Penal Satellite One, where Whitehall would be held until trial. 

You know the Admiral was putting some portion of his reputation on the line trusting you with this job, and you weren't about to let him down. 

But it didn't turn out that way. There must have been a leak somewhere, either on your ship or at United Worlds Command, because in an isolated sector of open space you were approached and attacked by a ramshackle pirate cruiser. 

The pirate crew had come for their leader. They made their intentions clear immediately, ordering you to heave to and be boarded. 

Of course you were not about to give up your prisoner without a fight, but their rag-tag ship, festooned with weapons, outgunned your ship's meager trio of laser cannons and its small crew. 

After an all-too-brief battle your ship was boarded, and as far as you know, your crew completely wiped out by the ruthless marauders. You wonder why you're still alive, guessing that your good fortune comes only due to the possibility you may yet be of some use to the pirates. 

Now, Whitehall, with a keycode for the Brig he must have tortured out of your Security Officer, escorts you personally to the cell and shoves you in. He laughs as the door locks behind you...

You're in a small, smooth-walled room with barely enough area to stand. A pair of simple bunk beds occupy most of the cramped space. There is a panel near the door. A faint smell of ozone is coming from the 
vent high above the beds. The pirates must have started some electrical fires. The only door is 
north
, but it's closed and locked.

Brig


You're in a small, smooth-walled room with barely enough area to stand. A pair of simple bunk beds occupy most of the cramped space. There is a panel near the door. A faint smell of ozone is coming from the 
vent high above the beds. The pirates must have started some electrical fires. The only door is 
north
, but it's closed and locked.

Void: The Center


This is the center, apparently. The planes of existence stretch out around you; some open and beckoning, some blocked to your spirit. Most are esoteric and of little importance to you, but you are drawn to several: the physical, or 
literal
 plane; the plane of 
structure
; the plane of 
shape
; and the plane of 
essence
.

This place seems to revolve around a multi-dimensional object, a 
monolith
 which seems to continue through all the planes. Your sight cannot penetrate it.

Welcome to the 
Fifth Praser Maze,
 a product of Sadistic Software (on the Beat-Your-Nose Tour.) The Maze was designed, written, ported to the Web, and then ported again to Z-code by Andrew Plotkin 
<erkyrath@eblong.com>
.


The Rules:



Wander around. Puzzles will be posed. Eventually you win.


Philosophy:



Some games make their puzzles too dense, by packing too many puzzles into the same sets of clues. Some make theirs too sparse, by putting in too many red herrings. I have tried to achieve a balance, by doing both.


Playing the Game:



Type one of the highlighted words to go in a direction, examine an object, or talk to a creature. You do not need to use Adventure-style commands like "take sword" or "read parchment". A single word will work.

Type a creature's name to begin speaking to it. (Merely naming its species is rarely sufficient!) Creatures often ask questions, or pose riddles. When you are speaking to a creature, you will see a double ">>" prompt. You can then type a word or phrase to try to answer the riddle. If you are correct, you will be rewarded.

(You can still move in directions, and examine objects, at the ">>" prompt.)


Special commands:



void
 will always return you to the starting location.

look
 or 
l
: look at the location again.

about
 and 
credits
: show this message, and the game's credits.

save
 and 
restore
: save your position to a file, and restore it.

quit
 or 
q
: end the game.



Free hint:



Don't make assumptions about what you're being asked.

Are you sure you want to quit? 

=== promoted.z5 (v5) ===
     The e-mail has a surprising tone for a declaration of doom.



--------------------

From: Your Boss!

To: You

CC: Everyone



     Congratualtions!  Due to attrition among the ranks of middle managers, you have been promoted to management as of right now.  Have someone move your telephone and computer to your new office in the management section, and call me before the end of the day.



--------------------



     There is no reason to ask for whom the bell tolls, it tolls for you.  First, that message went to everyone, announcing that you have been promoted.  As soon as your back is turned it will be so full of daggers you could open a cutlery shop.  On top of that, your phone has been broken for months.



     You tried begging, bribery, even threats.  You just can not get a new phone.  Now, you have to move to the new office, with a new phone, before the end of the day.  If you don't, you won't lose the promotion, you will lose your job.  Most new managers become sacrificial scapegoats for the board of directors on their first day.



     You will just have to be smarter than those other fledgling managers.  If you have problems, you can always resort to "Big D's Guide to Corporate Survival" (ie. the walkthrough).  You keep it in your desk drawer.



    Well, there is work to be done.  Get that phone and get your equipment to the new office.

     The state of your hair is very important in the corporate environment.  Yours is short and neatly combed.  Just right for a programmer or manager.

At the Show


You're in a dark, poorly lit and packed club. Everyone's staring at the band as they go about tuning and shifting their instruments. The guy next to you has a mohawk that flops over to the side, as if the heat had wilted it. In contrast, the skinhead in front of you is reacting to the heat like a Mexican jumping bean, the muscles of his back tensing and releasing, tensing and releasing.

Before you can do anything, the band explodes into action. The crowd coalesces into a single entity and leans towards them, falls back, ripples spastically. Being part of this lurching creature makes your spine tingle.

You're pressed from all sides by people suddenly activated by sound -- but you can't hear anything. You can practically feel the sonic waves, see it on the faces of the people around you... You strain to hear the music... 

The guy with the mohawk plants his boot in the skinhead's linked hands. His pierced nostrils flaring, hands gripping the skinhead's shoulders, he launches himself on the crowd. Improbably, they hold him aloft as he rolls over a bed made of their shoulders, heads and outstretched hands. You can't quite believe what you're seeing, and suddenly you hear something:

"Honey?"

You whip around and look to see who spoke, but there's nothing except the unremarkable brick wall of the club lined with people standing on chairs to get a better view. None of them are looking at you.

You look back. The guy with the mohawk is still rolling over the crowd, but for some reason he's got a tie on. And his blue hair is flickering like flames. The skinhead offers his linked hands to boost you up, and you quickly put your foot in. But your foot is bare. He looks at you, his dark eyes questioning. You realize with dawning horror that it isn't just your foot that's bare -- you're  in your underwear. You feel, rather than see, the eyes of the people in the crowd move towards you, brace yourself for the mocking laughter sure to ensue... 

"Honey! Get up!"

You're in your bed.

Your mother bustles in with your uniform, freshly ironed, and hangs it on your bathroom doorknob. "OK, honey, we're off," she says, stopping at the foot of your bed and putting her hands on her hips. "Better hurry or you'll miss your bus. Don't want to be late for the very first day of high school!"

You smile weakly as she kisses you goodbye and leaves, trying to rekindle the feelings in your dream.

Your room is a mess -- posters slowly peel off the walls to join the small heaps of clothes that spot the floor like death mounds. There's a path south through the junk from your bed to your bathroom, one going north to the rest of the house.

Have you EXAMINED everything around you? Have you checked to see what you have in your INVENTORY recently? If you're trying to get useful things out of characters, ASK ____ ABOUT ____ will be the most revealing. Keep in mind that 80% of the commands needed to win the game are in the format VERB NOUN (ie. ATTACK STU). If you'd like to see how far into the game you are, check your SCORE, and you can UNDO one turn. There's also INFO on the game itself.

And that's all the help you get. Hints are for fucking posers.

=== pytho.z8 (v8) ===




A small room.  Three men; you recognize only one.

"You, Soteria," says the leader.  "I understand you have an invitation to the Celebration of the Night of the Comet."

Heat floods your face.  How does he know that?  "I have an invitation, but I wasn't sure-- that is, I wasn't planning--"

"You'll go," he says.

The words die half-formed.  An urgent command overrides your personal doubts.

"What am I to do?"

"Speak to the Physician -- he's one of ours, but we've been unable to speak to him of late.  Find out anything he knows about the King's illness.  And protect the King."

"From what?"

The leader smiles a little wryly.  "I wish I could tell you, girl.  This is the Night of the Comet.  It could be anything."



                    [ Hit RETURN to continue... ]


As you turn to go, one of the others touches your arm.  "How did you get an invitation? We've all been trying for months--"

"Someone gave it to me," you say curtly.  "A rendezvous of sorts."

"But--"

"Don't worry, I'll attend to my duty," you say.  Adding, mostly to yourself: "The masked man won't be there anyway, I'm sure."  Since he became an outlaw shortly after he invited you...

Terrace


A terrace of lunar marble, surrounded by a low balustrade.  It gleams softly of its own in the darkening night.

To the west, shallow steps descend to the enclosure of the Square Garden; east beckons the brilliance of the Sun Court.




The minister of the moon stands at the far end, gazing upwards.

Ordinarily you do not bother, but tonight... tonight you let your mother's own maid work her full magic.  You look magnificent, all emeralds and silk and high-piled hair, so that you startle yourself every time you catch a reflection in one of the gilded mirrors.




"A fine night," the Moon Minister comments, though he barely turns to acknowledge your presence.  "The viewing is good.  When the comet rises it will be clearer than the moon itself."

At any time you can see from the status bar to whom you are talking; sometimes there is also a list of up to four comments that you can make.  Choose one of these by typing >A, >B, >C, etc. at the prompt, just as you would any other verb.

If you are dissatisfied with the selection, you can also type >TOPIC <SOMETHING>.  So for instance if your options listed at the moment are all vapid remarks about fashion and you would rather say, "Pass 
the Stilton, please," you might try >TOPIC CHEESE.  >TOPIC does not cost a turn to use, so you can explore a number of topics if you're looking for something specific to say.  For your convenience this is also abbreviated to >T.  So >T CHEESE would work, too.

To talk to a new person, type >GREET <PERSON>; to say goodbye try >T GOODBYE.  To revert to the topic you were on at the end of the last conversational exchange, >UNTOPIC.

For a list of all the characters you have encountered so far, >PERSONAE (or just >P).

Coffee House


The book on the round, maroon table is looking at you. In this sunny May afternoon, you wanted to read the book and be outside also. So you took it and came to this coffee house. You are wondering what the protagonist will do next.

You glance at the people who are in light colored clothes and look somewhat dizzy from the lightly blowing wind. The umbrella over you provides an ideal dimness. From the speaker near the entrance of the inner café, a woman is singing an ultimately boring French song.

Thus, everything is so suitable to read.

Four rounds have gone by. You and the red robot have remained neck and neck for the lead, with two wins each. The robot that emerges victorious in the fifth round will become Champion of Robotic Boxing, with all the praise and adulation that title implies. 

Also, you get a pretty sweet endorsement deal from a leading gear manufacturer. 

The final round is about to begin. Get out there and win!

          The Resident



  'You just visit the WEB, I live here.'



  Copyright 1995 by Mike DeSanto



  You are awake.  The clock says it is 2: 30 AM, so thee must be a reason you are awake.  Trusting your instincts, you get the Beretta handlaser from the end table.



  You move silently toward the bedroom door.  There are people who hate you, but most of them don't know who you are, and you just moved in here.  A change of residence and name come with every completed job.  There have been no hitches or displeased customers lately.



  Just as you reach for the door these thoughts are shattered.  The door disappears in a blinding, searing light.  Through the agony you feel the dresser opposite the door hit you in the small of the back, a trivial pain to the fire in the front of your body.



  Then something else starts.  A pushing feeling starting at your right hip.  It continues diagonally to your left shoulder, leaving sharp points of suffering, like ten thousand bee stings across your body.  You feel yourself falling, but never feel the floor.



  With a start, you are awake.  Looking around, you see the red traceries and yellow disks of the WEB stretching out all around you.  you must have fallen asleep on line again.



  Your left arm itches, you must be laying on it.  You reach for the LOGOUT button, and find nothing.  The logout is gone.  Looking around a little more, everything is gone!  Your programs, even your Icon!  You spent hours on that icon.  Getting just the right amount of five o'clock shadow, just the right tackiness to the slippers.  It was a masterpiece!



  Just as you are starting to get nervous, a message appears on your deck.  Strange dreams just before strange messages make you unhappy.  At least you have your backups at Bob's.



    You are standing in a standard Public node.  The 'ground' is a neon yellow disk, large enough for everyone present to fit, no matter how many people are here.



    In the center of the disk is a red pole with arrow shaped signs.  This is the transfer point to all connected nodes.



    Next to the Transfer Point is a large sign which reads "INFORMATION" in tall block capitals.  You can not read the rest without looking more closely.



    As usual, there are hundreds of people moving through this node.  Since this is where everyone starts when they log in, it tends to be a busy place.

This is the Z-machine port of a game originally written for Rexx-Adventure. Rexx-Adventure is a point-and-click interface for textadventures designed by Mike DeSanto. To cite the Rexx-Adventure documentation:


        "Rexx-Adventure is a text adventure engine for OS/2.  The fact that it is an engine means that it is not a set, single adventure.  It is a framework for writing new adventures."


And about gameplay it says:


        "To use an object, click on it.  This will display a list of appropriate actions for that object.  Simply choose the action you wish to perform.  In some cases, an indirect object will be necessary.  In this case, the indirect object window will appear, and you choose one from the list.  The results of your action will be displayed in the text window."


This version of the game simulates Rexx-Adventure by using menus.


Z-machine port by J. Steingraeber 1997, compiled with Linux Inform 6.13


For menu-navigation use the cursor keys or


               '8' for cursor up,

                         |

 '4' for cursor left,  --+--  '6' for cursor right,

                         |

               '2' for cursor down.


Use 'Return' to select an entry.

Use 'Backspace' or 'Esc' or '9' to cancel a menu.


The number of menu lines can be changed in the System Commands.

 To:    The Resident

 From:  Ringer

 Subject:  Welcome back.



    Greetings, Resident.  I am known as Ringer, and I am your new employer.  The doctors say you may be confused by the trauma you have suffered, so I will go over the events of the last few days.



    Three days ago, a very nearly successful attempt was made on your life.  An assassin used a shaped explosive to enter your room, and used a flechette rifle to saw you in half from shoulder to hip.



    Luckily, the police and ambulance arrived very quickly, and you were taken to a hospital.  Once there, you were placed on life support while your credit rating was checked.  On my instructions, you were declared dead and brought to a private hospital, where you were implanted with a full nervous link.  All of your senses are fed by the WEB at this point.  To disconnect you from the WEB would leave you in a world here there is only pain, and you would quickly go mad.



    They say that you are called the Resident because you spend more time in the WEB than out of it.  I find it ironic that your name is now more true than ever.  If you perform the tasks I give you satisfactorily, I will have you fitted with cybernetics to replace the limbs and organs that you lost, or with a Clone body, your choice.



    Before you start getting ideas, I did not have you attacked. I do not know who did or why.  I was planning to hire you anyway, because your name is well known on the WEB.  I have some work for you to do.  When you are not busy with my tasks, feel free to track down your assassin.  When you find the who ordered the hit, I will deal with them for you.



    As for your first task, I need to gain entry into Geneva Materials Science Corporation.  You must infiltrate their computer system and sabotage the security systems to let me and my strike team into the building.  Any necessary information about the team will be provide when you are in the system.



    You will receive more instructions when you need them.  Work quickly to finish this task, and good luck finding your attacker.



 The Ringer

=== reverb.z5 (v5) ===


Life sucks. Today has been just another crummy day in another dismal spring which you've spent delivering pizzas. This afternoon has totally been dragging, except for that bit of excitement an hour ago when you broke the soda machine. You thought your boss was going to rip you a new orifice.

Anyway, you've just finished mopping up behind the counter. There's only one more hour left on your shift and you're anxious to get out of here. Go home, watch the tube, blast some tunes, maybe scan the new "Surfers Monthly" magazine... gonna be a nice relaxing evening.

Shyeah, right. That's what YOU think.

Behind the Counter


You are behind the counter at "Mr. Tasty's Pizza Parlor", where you are currently working. Not much of a job, but it keeps you from going broke during the nine months of the year when you can't pull down the bucks as surfing instructor. The rest of the parlor is southwest.

There is something pressing that you think you have to do, but you can't think what it might be.

Rules:


Black (X) moves first.

To make a legal move, your piece must be placed next to a piece of the opposite color. The move is legal if somewhere on the column/row/diagonal in the direction of the opposite piece is one of your own pieces. All opposite pieces in this direction are then captured by you and will change to your color.

If your piece is placed next to several pieces of the opposite color then you capture those pieces also.

If you have no possible moves you will be forced to pass your turn. To manually pass simply press "P". Two consecutive passes (one by you and one by the computer will end the game.

If the computer cannot make a move it will display a message. You continue to make your moves as normal.

The game is over when all fields are occupied or when no side can make a legal move. The winner of the game is the one with the most pieces when the game is over.


Controls: Use the arrow keys to move the cursor (the "?") around the board. When the "?" is where you want to place your piece, press the space bar. You can also use the "W", "A", "S" and "Z" keys to move the cursor.

Most of the menu choices should be self-explanatory. "C" allows you to change sides. Press "P" to pass, "Q" to quit and "H" to diplay this information. "M" changes the game's mode between fast and slow. In "slow" mode, the game will pause after you make a move, so that you can see the results of your move. In "fast" mode, the computer will make it's move immediately after you make yours, then display the results.

Train


A model train display covers a 4' x 8' pool table.  Taped to the right corner of the table, a yellow ribbon hangs.  The lighting is hazy.

In brief:

A "text model" requires examination.  But while examining something does not necessarily imply just looking at it, the command "examine" (or simply "x") usually does.  The e(x)amine, listen, touch and smell commands are implemented on most objects.  Taste is pretty much frowned upon.

"x display" will get you started at each perspective.  To move to a perspective you can type its relative position or its name.

Generally etiquette will forbid you from attempting a lot of standard "adventuring" things.  You should be able to discern when and where you can perform these actions (e.g. move, press).  But don't be afraid to try something, if nothing else for the humor potential (key word:  "potential".)

Score is available as a vague indicator of how much you've experienced.  Type exit to leave the game.

"You can't miss it," they said. "A white house in a clearing with a small mailbox outside; just open the kitchen window and the entrance to the Great Underground Empire isn't far away."


You found the house and the window all right, and a trapdoor leading down. But as the trapdoor crashed shut behind you, you realized that something was very wrong. Surely the GUE shouldn't look like a large square room with bare walls, and what about those menacing shapes advancing towards you...?

This is a port of the rogue 5.3-
clone
 code.  
If you're used to the original or the PC version, expect to 
encounter some small differences.


Concise help can be viewed during the game by pressing "?".  Pressing it twice 
will put the game into a menu of help topics which are hopefully a little 
more... helpful.


For a list of changes in recent releases, read the "News" help topic.  
Don't forget -- it's good for your soul.

You feel like such a whore. 

First they washed you.  They rubbed your skin with a soft cloth, made you clean and gleaming.  Then they painted you a face, a cute little 'hello, sailor' smirk.  After examining your weight, luster and overall beauty, they determined your price. 

Then they put you out with the others, to wait for passers-by.

Pumpkin Patch


It's a crisp autumn day.  Around you, leaves of gold and orange hang on the trees; Farmer Brown and his wife draw scary faces on the scarecrows to the south.  The road is to the east.  Far off toward the northwest, a small, oddly shaped building sits atop a small hill.

Bedroom
 (on 
the 
bed
)


When the springy energy of muscle long ago gave way to a slothful paunch, you didn't mind. You simply redirected your energies from the libertine idylls of youth to the ruthless game of business, and in that you succeeded admirably. You built Splinecorp from the humble beginnings of your parents' garage into the world's most prominent manufacturer of electronic goods. You invested your whole adult life into the company, and it paid you back handsomely, you sometimes consider as you relax in your sprawling, isolated mansion. But age takes its toll. Even your healthy middle-aged paunch began to dissolve, what remained of your muscles were consumed by sluggish board meetings, and innumerable diseases began to gnaw at you from the inside out. Your increasing frailty has confined you to this bed for the last five years, but your mind, of course, is as sharp as ever and you have no intent of relinquishing your place on the Splinecorp executive board. Fortunately, here in your linen prison, you've provided yourself with the tools to look after yourself: the rack of monitors hanging from ceiling keeps you informed, and of course your faithful Splinecorp-manufactured robots stand by, waiting your command. Hanging on the eastern wall is an ornate tapestry. And standing next to your bed is a comprehensive array of tubes, drips, and associated medical machines, and also a small nightstand. To the south is a doorway to the hallway.


The phone starts ringing.

Bedroom
 (on 
the 
bed
)


This spacious room serves as your bedroom, your hospital, your jail. Your enormous, elaborate bed occupies the bulk of the space here. Next to the bed is an array of medical devices, several are which are plugged directly into your body. Also next to the bed is a nightstand. Hanging on the eastern wall is an ornate tapestry, and the northern wall is dominated by a window from which you could see your garden, if it weren't dark outside. Suspended from the ceiling is a metal rack holding several monitors, your links to the outside world. To the south is a doorway to the hallway.



You
 can 
see 
Levo
 and 
Pravo
 here.

School Days: Prologue




You have recently lived in Toronto but then your parents moved away. You really loved them. But, you were kidnapped and locked in this house. Those kidnappers really should be put in jail.

Well, you don't want to stay here any longer than you can help. You want to get to school on this Saturday to see your grade nine pals. And last night you were shoved in this house. As you wake up, you realise...


 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
[Please press any key to begin.]





... that you are all alone in a locked bedroom, and you need to find a way out.

Bedroom


This bedroom is a medium-sized room, with an ugly flower wallpaper. A dresser sits in an awkward corner. An entrance to a small bathroom is to the west while the door to the main corridor to the east. A cheap window sits at one side. A trapdoor in the ceiling seems to lead up to an attic, although high up.




The door to the hallway is currently closed.




The trapdoor is closed, blocking the way into the attic.



A mahogany double dresser sits here. 
In the dresser, 
there are no open drawers.

a 
wall clock
, 
a 
night-table
 (on

 and 
a

 and 
a 
bed
 (on 
which

sheets
)
 here.

You have just entered the stern airlock aboard the MV Pollux. You have been diving the coral reefs around the middle keys while the Pollux has been patrolling the Florida Straits near the southern end of Florida.


You can enter [Help] at the start for help relevant to this game, then [About] and [Credits] for additional information.

In general you will be able to converse with the non player chaaracters [NPCs] within this adventure. Just enter [Talk] to [NPC].

Note: When within the [Talk] menu, just select the number '1'. Pressing enter drops you out of the talk menu. You can get back to the talk menu by entering [Talk] to [NPC] again. It is generally best to choose the option in the #1 position as you converse, but it is not required.

Airlock


The airlock is just big enough to accommodate you and Bart. It is a pressure equalization port below the water line that allows divers safe entry into the ship.

The main passageway is forward (Fore).

The Director's office surprises you. You had expected something modern with clean lines, and plenty of glass and aluminium; not this dark and cluttered room, reminiscent of a Victorian library or some ancient professor's study. Also, you had expected that you were being shown in for an interview with the Director, in person, whereas there is clearly no-one else here in this office.

Type HELP at any command prompt for help with using this game (but no hints about the puzzles).


Press any key to begin the game.


The Director's assistant follows you into the room. 

"As I told you, the Board of Trustees were impressed with your interview and they fully understand from your application why you see this as your perfect job. However, you failed to convince them on a single point: if you wish to become the new Director of the Museum and Institute for Puzzles and Problem Solving, they would like some evidence of your interest in solving problems. The retiring Director has been asked to assess you on that single point and, rather than interview you, he has set you an unusual test." 

With that, the assistant hands you a manilla envelope, then continues. 

"I am instructed to give you this envelope. Please read it and act on its contents. When you are ready to meet the Director, please ring the bell on his desk and I shall bring him in. He will ask you a single question. If you answer correctly, the job is yours: answer incorrectly and we shall have to look for a new candidate." 

The assistant moves briskly out of the room, wishing you a cheery "Good luck!" before shutting the door behind him. You hear the sound of a key being turned in the lock.





Office of the Director


This room reminds you of a Victorian study: it is roughly square and all the exposed walls are panelled with dark oak, up to a height of about six feet, with bare cream plaster above. In the centre of the room is an old mahogany desk, with a leather chair behind it. Beyond the desk is a stone fireplace, with a framed painting above it. One of the side walls is completely taken up with a book case, most of which is closed with glass doors. On the opposite wall, above a wooden table, is the only window, and sole source of light in this rather gloomy room. In the fourth wall is the single door. There is a clutter of miscellaneous items everywhere, and in the four corners of the room, you can see a hatstand, an antique globe, a wooden corner shelf and a low cupboard. 


At present you are standing beside the Director's desk, in the middle of the room.

If you are not familiar with interactive fiction, some useful commands are:

* INVENTORY or INV or I to list what you are holding
* GET <object> or TAKE <object> to pick things up, and DROP <object> to drop them
* LOOK to get a general description of the room
* EXAMINE <object> or X <object> to take a close look at something
* PUT <object> ON (or IN) <object>
* OPEN <object> or CLOSE <object> if you would expect it to be openable.

The puzzle to be solved in this game involves some numbers and words. To save the player from having to record every possible clue on a piece of paper, all potentially relevant (and potentially irrelevant!) numbers, letters and words are noted for you and can be reviewed by typing NOTE or REVIEW, at any command prompt.

This game takes place entirely in one room, so the compass directions which are widely used in interactive fiction have no relevance to this game.

Although the location is a single room, the player's focus of attention is directed on one part of it at a time. This means that some commands will behave slightly differently, depending on the current focus. For instance, if the player is sitting at the desk, the LOOK command will give more detail about objects which are on the desk. Similarly, if the player is at the desk and types a command such as TAKE BOOK, the game will assume that this refers to the book on the desk (if there is one) rather than the one on, say, the bookcase. If you actually want the one on the bookcase, make it clear that this is the one you are referring to by typing TAKE RED BOOK, for instance, (if it is red). Doing so will not only allow you to take the book, but will automatically switch the focus to the part of the room where it is located. This is all less complicated than it sounds, and avoids the alternative of the game continually asking you to clarify which of several similar objects you are referring to.

Another unusual feature of the game is that, because the game takes place in a single location, there is little point in collecting every portable object into a huge inventory. The player doesn't have a "sack" and it would be unrealistic for the player to make a minute examination of a small scrap of paper whilst carrying armfuls of boxes, bags and clothing. Hence, quite a lot of the larger objects are "automatically" put down by the player, when attention switches to a new object. This should not be an inconvenience, as the object remains accessible to the player at all times, anyway. If you lose track of where something is in the room, you can type WHERE IS THE BELL (or whatever you are looking for) and you will normally be told the location of the item.

Nothing in the game can inflict a fatal injury on the player and it should not be possible to manipulate the objects so as to make the game unwinnable, until the very end. 

I hope you enjoy the game!

The compass directions aren't relevant: firstly, there is only one exit (which is locked!) and, secondly, you don't have a compass. Although you can distinguish up and down, without a compass, there are no exits in those directions, either.

Well, now that my girlfriend's mad at me, where were we? Ah, right.


It's kind of boring here. I hear the king hasn't put anybody in the dungeon in over a year. Must make you feel special. It's drafty, being up in the tower, and the stones in the wall have chips and various--- do you really care? They're old. The door looks pretty sturdy. There's some light coming into the room from a window about, uh, twice your height up. Can we leave?



I

a 
tapestry
, 
a 
bed
, 
a 
vase
, 
a 
mirror
, and 
an 
annoying git in a dress
 here.

=== sgate.z5 (v5) ===


The last thing that you remember is standing before the wizard Lakmir as he waved his hands. Now you find yourself staring at an entryway which lies at the edge of a forest. The druid's words ring in your ears:

"Within the castle Shadowgate lies your quest. The dreaded Warlock Lord will use his black magic to raise the Behemoth from the dark depths. The combination of his evil arts and the great titan's power will surely destroy us all! You are the last of the line of kings, the seed of prophecy that was foretold eons ago. Only you can stop the evil one from darkening our world forever! Fare thee well."

Gritting your teeth, you swear by your god's name that you will destroy the Warlock Lord!

Odd, how the light just makes your apartment gloomier. Pre-dawn darkness pools in the corners and around the tops of walls. Your desk lamp glares yellow, but the shadows only draw your eyes and deepen.


Not much of an apartment, no.
 One desk, paper-piled, with a dusty computer shoved to the side.
 Your futon
.
 Second-hand stereo
 sitting on a cardboard crate
.
 A kitchen nook one way and a bathroom nook the other, with a closet to the side.
 A broad mirror tries to make the place seem twice its size; it halfway works.
 One window, whose shade is
 down
, and the front door
 firmly shut
.



Your luggage is piled untidily by the door.
 
A potted 
hyacinth
 sits beneath the window.



You are sprawled on the futon, staring up into that gloom. Your eyes feel gritty. But it's too late -- early -- no time left for sleep, anyway. In a few hours your ride will arrive.


On 
the 
desk
 are
 
your
 
to-do list
 and 
a 
travel book
.

This is a one-room game set in your apartment. ...But perhaps you've already gathered that.


SHADE mostly uses the standard vocabulary of interactive fiction. You may find the command "find..." (or "where is...") convenient, though not critically important.


SHADE is copyright 2000 by Andrew Plotkin (erkyrath@eblong.com). He began coding it on the morning of September 2, 2000, and raced like the wind to finish it in time for the Sixth Annual IF Competition. (SHADE placed tenth, which is pretty darn good, considering the overall excellence of the entries that year.) For more IF by the same author, see

    <http://www.eblong.com/zarf/if.html>

SHADE may be distributed for free, but not sold or included in any for-profit collection without written permission from the author.


All hail the beta-tester: Michael Kinyon (still inevitable after all these years). And the people who sent bug reports after the competition, who include (but are not limited to): Ross Presser, Gunther Schmidl, Matthew Murray, Joe Mason, Nick Wolfe, Caleb Wilson, Neil Cerutti, Jason McIntosh, Daryl McCullough, Lelah Conrad, Jeff Hall. And -- this game is dedicated to Meatball Fulton.

Another day wasted as guest of the Empress, a wretchedly long tour of the breath-taking Boreal Falls, conducted as ever by the Lady Amilia. As if she weren't bad enough, an honour guard of soldiers, their breast-plates red in the setting sun, march ahead of the procession and protect you from seeing anything unrehearsed. It's a dog's life being an Ambassador.

Watling Street
 (
in
 
the 
cushioned basket
)


The ancient paved road stretches for miles to the south, turning very slowly to the northeast along a mossy stone wall. From up here on your elephant's wickerwork basket, you're just level with the branches of the old Imperial hunting woods inside the wall.

Having been stuck in this cushioned basket with the Lady Amilia every day for a fortnight, you're just desperate to get away.




The procession of elephants shuffles on, their enormous soles slapping onto the flagstones with a dull, regular boom.

West of the house


You are standing west of a white house with a boarded front door.


You blink. Boarded? You came all this way and the door is

Lorenzo snickers. "I'll give you a hundred to spend the night in Count Ruggino's house."

"I'll do it! Wait. Why Ruggino's?"

"He's a suicide. They say his house is haunted."

"Haunted? I don't believe in ghosts."

Count Ruggino's house lours in the dim air like a gathering of gravestones. The road makes a circle before it, then runs north back to Firenze.




A heavy wooden door leads in to the south.




A statue stands in the center of a dry fountain.

SLEEP is an important command. If you try sleeping and you can't, you will get a hint about why you can't.

THINK is not a critical command but might be useful.

Classes finally ended, and you walk home through the nearly deserted campus. It's a Thursday, and you had night classes, so almost no one is around. Up a few flights of stairs, you slip the key into the lock, turn, and walk inside. Turning swiftly, you lock the door, and pick up your todo list. Still, you just don't feel like doing work. Your heart is heavy, and you feel you won't really be able to get anything done.

Dorm Room


This is your room, where you've have some of your most cherished moments. It's been just about half a year since the start of classes, but even in that short period, you've made many memories. Mornings are the most pleasant here, sunlight shines through the windows, casting the room in the golden hue of the dawn. Your desk is decorated with pictures, pencils, snacks, and books. The walls are sparse, mostly white, no posters or anything, you prefer it neat. Almost everything is ordered, and not a thing is usually out of place. Your bed is in one corner of the room. The windows are dark, it's night time out.




A nightstand is beside the desk, with a few frills on top.




A fair sized metal typewriter is on the desk.




Your writing notebook rests here, but it's unimportant to you.

...Flowers. James knows that I love flowers, especially roses. He works part time, just to buy me flowers. I know they are expensive, but... I love them too much to tell him that I know he works for them.


Your name is Amy, and you're an eighteen year old college freshman. This is your first year, and much of it has been hard for you. Events from last week have been especially bad. You're feeling sick, tired, depressed, and hardly motivated to do anything. You never were the type to wear too much jewelry or makeup, but recently, you haven't worn any at all, it just doesn't seem to be worth the effort.

It's been ten years since your stationfall on Space Station Gamma Delta Gamma 777-G 59/59. Your heroics in saving the galaxy from the evil alien pyramid resulted in a big promotion, but your life of dull paperwork has been replaced by a life of dull people work: escorting ambassadors, high-ranking officers of the Stellar Patrol, and government officials; and inspecting starships and space stations. Today you find yourself in a space scooter bound for a space station to perform a spot check, and also deliver some radioactive isotopes for their reactor, using the scooter instead of the teleport in order to surprise everyone. You've been a bit delayed due to a diplomatic crisis on Omicron III and your scooter isn't equipped with communication equipment, so you are arriving unannounced. Hey, rank does have its privileges, and it is meant to be a spot check...

Scooter
 (on 
the 
pilot's couch
)


   You are in the cramped one-man Class Eight Space Scooter, with a couch for the pilot. Through the viewport, you see a rapidly approaching Space Station. Below the viewport is a slot. 
The scooter's metre square steel hatch which governs life and death (in space, anyway) is currently 
closed.



You

see 
a 
toolbox
 (which 
is

This game is based on the example transcript included with Infocom's Planetfall game, by Steve Meretzky. All Infocom games are now the property of Activision. It understands the following commands:

North, South, East, West, Fore, Aft, Starboard, Port, Up, Down, In, Out, Exit, Examine, Look, Look through, Diagnose, Time, Score, Wait, Shake, Open, Cut, Close, Lock, Unlock, Take, Drop, Type, Push, Kick, Crush, Play, Sit, Stand, Read, Save, Restore, Restart, Quit, Brief, Superbrief, Verbose, Version, Again, Oops, Eat, Drink, Use, Break, Put, Make, Give <OBJECT> to <ACTOR>, Tell <ACTOR> about <SUBJECT>, Plug <OBJECT1> in <OBJECT2>, Show <OBJECT> to <ACTOR>, Unplug <OBJECT>, Footnote <NUMBER>, Wait <NUMBER>, Wake <ACTOR> ...

The game descriptions for this games use fore, aft, port, and starboard for directions which can be abbreviated to f, a, p, sb. If you are not comfortable using these directions you can still use respectively north, south, west, east which can be abbreviated to n, s, w, e. Up and Down work as usual. You can examine AND read books.

Some of the commands have to be combined with objects, carried by the player, or found in rooms. The maximum score is 
23
 at present. The puzzles aren't very complicated; just examine EVERYTHING, and you should be able to solve them. Good luck, and enjoy! And if you think Activision should resurrect Planetfall II, LET THEM KNOW.

There may be some spelling mistakes in this game, but probably not as many as you think. The spelling is British English, which is not exactly the same as American English (which I assume many players use). That's my story and I'm sticking to it.

When the program is run using WInfocom, the opening text may be a bit garbled; just type RESTART.

I would like to thank the following people for their help in this project:
David Dyte for organizing the 1998 Interactive Fiction Competition and Technical Advice while I was learning Inform. Everyone on the rec.arts.int-fiction newsgroup who gave me technical advice (too numerous to mention).
Version 1 Beta Testers: Vincent Lynch, Mary K. Kuhner, Stephen Robert Norris, Stuart Andrew Moore and Imran Ghory.
Version 2 Beta Testers: James Braun, Bronxelf (a former Infocom Tester who worked with Steve Meretzky), Tom Lorimer, Jason F. Finx (a star grammer checker), Chad Schultz and Mark Silcox.

You can Email the author at me@dmledgard.freeserve.co.uk with error reports, possible improvements etc...

Monastery Chapel


You are standing in a monastery chapel. All around you, fellow Brothers of the Order are standing, chanting. The eerie droning voices seem to reverberate into the air. At the front of the chapel, Brother Joseph stands in deep concentration, holding the Rod of the Ancients.

Brother Joseph now speaks directly to the entire Order.

"Fellow Brothers, the year, as you know, is 976 GUE. A difficult time indeed. Ten years have passed since the Cataclysm brought forth by the Circle of Enchanters changed our world forever. The outside world as we know it is in turmoil. A period of great change is upon all of us."

Hello Player!

SPIRITWRAK, An Interactive Fantasy Adventure
If you're new to interactive fiction games, I lack the space here to give an adequate description, but in short, you're a character in a story, able to interact with objects, places and other things (using regular english sentences) in order to reach your goal, which is to figure out how to "solve" the story. For a real description, you might want to check out documents located at ftp.gmd.de.

For those more experienced players, if you're looking for on-line clues, etc., sadly, you won't find them (the Z5 code is getting rather obscenely large as I write this). A short verb list is contained in the README file that you should have received with this game (or should be able to find at the same place you found this game). Beyond that, if you're truly desperate, you can post a note on the rec.arts.int-fiction usenet newsgroup, or send me email.

Thanks for playing!

Brother Joseph continues speaking.

"Our order has always maintained the strictest secrecy. Few outside of our order know of our existence. We are the keepers of the mystic balance that which embodies pure magic that can keep our world safe. It has always been thus -- we watch over all of Quendor, never interfering in the affairs of others, yet striving to maintain harmony."

Brother Joseph continues speaking.

"But we can no longer depend on enchantments to keep outsiders at bay. Magic as we know it is dying. The dreaded Age of Science is already upon us, and in short time, our order will be discovered, and the balance will be no more. Many of our order have gone out into the world in secret, in attempts to repair what has been broken, but alas, this appears to be impossible."

Bathroom


It's midnight. There's blood everywhere because, hot diggety ding-dong damn, you just murdered someone with a plastic spork for trying to destroy the Universe. I mean, congratulations and all, but seriously, that's just...weird, man.The corpse of the man you most royally ensporked for trying to destroy the Universe with only his pinkie finger (he can do that, you know) is lying in front of you on the floor of the derelict, teal, horrible-smelling men's room. There's an entrance to the hallway of the abandoned community center that you're in to the South.




The murder weapon, the spork, is clutched in your trembling fist. Despite how much ass you kicked, you are slightly disturbed. You drop the spork on the floor of the bloody bathroom with a wet click in your disbelief as to how much ass you truly kicked.

Nice try, but fatso needs a forklift.


spork

The spork is yours, and you are ready to kick some ass in a severe manner! Of course, you do feel some sympathy for - let's not get into that. You just killed a guy with a spork, have some pride!

"This is it!" he says as he dodges the last pothole and brings the truck to a stop. After twenty miles of the worst washboard road the country has to offer, you're just happy to have arrived.

You place your sandaled feet on solid ground and take a deep breath. The smells of autumn are at once sweet and earthy and full of the aroma of moisture and living things. A cool breeze blows in your face, soft and gentle. What a nice change, what a welcome relief from the tension and hustle of all you've left behind this weekend. It's just you and your husband, as he promised over a month ago.

You look around. What passes for the road you just traveled ends abruptly here. Over the last hour, bad asphalt gave way to gravel, which gave way, in turn, to the rutted two-track you see beside you. Ahead, the ruts continue, but it'll be on foot if you're to go any further. The old beater truck stands here, engine off but still ticking from the trip. Your husband closes the driver's door and comes around the rear to join you.

"How's my pretty lady?" he asks as he wraps his arms around you and places a kiss on your cheek from behind. "Tired, huh? Come on. Let's get the stuff. We'll be able to relax better once the tent's up."

He takes the two packs from the back of the truck and helps you into yours, then leads the way through the brush to the north. You roll up on the balls of your feet and give your pack a nudge, then pull the waist strap tight. Without looking back, you follow.

That was last night, and you hiked a short trail to a campsite off in the woods. Together you set up the tent, fixed a quick dinner, and fell asleep in each other's arms...






You wake with a start, something's missing, and you notice the sleeping bag is empty beside you. On his pillow is a handwritten note, which you collect. He must have crawled out early, as the sky is only now beginning to lighten.

You dress quickly, slip out of the tent, and follow the trail to the east.

Aspen Grove


You stand in the middle of a grove of aspen, which extends in all directions. Slender white trunks reach for the sky with long thin fingers, stroking the clouds that blow in the autumn breeze. Leaves of gold rattle as the winds shift, and here and there one floats to the ground to join others that crackle underfoot when you move. A narrow path disappears east into the trees, and a camping area is visible through a small opening to the west. North is a wide meadow.

"You," he always tells you, "are my pretty lady." You smile at the thought. He's always quick to tell you how he likes that smile, your easy laugh, your blue-green eyes that "sparkle" so. It's probably all just a little silly, but you like it nonetheless.

You've put this off too long.

The floppy was on the bureau when you got back home. Jeff must have left it before you drove him to the hospital for the last time. No label. Just your name, scrawled in pencil.

You suppose you owe it to his fans to find out what's on it. Maybe one last masterpiece. They'd like that.

The timestamps on the earliest files are decades old. You start with the first.

Staci Starlight, the captian of the Harbinger One.  At 16, 
you
 
are
 slim, with large eyes, an open and trusting face, and 
your
 chestnut brown hair is cut in a short pixie-like pageboy style.
 Although tall for 
your
 age, 
your
 innocent appearance causes most to underestimate 
your
 quick wit, keen intelligence, and un
ﬂ
appable determination. Only when one looks closely do they see the steely glint in 
your
 gunmetal grey eyes.  
Your
 white bodysuit uniform bares the small blue-cross captain's insignia on the collar.




The Harbinger One rocks from the attack by 
the 
War Bot Attack Ship
.  Var-P, the Harbinger One's computer, calls out that the hull has 
475
 points of structural integrity score remaining.

This game is really really good. If you disagree, screw you. The instructions 
are obvious to anyone with an IQ over that of a three-toed sloth, so it's no 
surprise to me at all that you pressed Y!



        (Please excuse the harsh manners of my 8th grade self.) 

        There are a possible 100 points to be attained, see if you can figure 
out everything.  Anyone who achieves 100 points can wear the title of "Grand 
High Pervert" and will learn the mysterious STIFFY SECRET.



        The original version contained a visit from Pamela's husband, but 
I wasn't able to get it to work right in this version.  Expect to see him in 
the future, along with more perversions. 
        Shouts go out to the appropriate people: Patrick Swesey, for giving 
me the inspiration;

Chris Cappelletti, who REALLY WANTED the game;

anybody 
else who I went to 8th grade with and motivated me to write a game, whether 
through encouragement or ostracization;  people with crappy computers - this 
piece of crap will run on a freaking ABACUS;

anyone who actualy plays the 
game to its conclusion; anyone who plays the game to its conclusion and 
DOESN'T 
write me a death threat; anyone who's never said something that rhymed by 
accident; and to anyone who has ever used the word "retrograde" (my favorite.) 


Thanks for playing.

=== stinkorswim.z8 (v8) ===






Another morning, another Minnow & Mommy class. It all started off normally enough, with nervous mothers holding up floatie-armed toddlers in the shallow end of the pool. Next came kicking, and bubble-blowing, and screaming... no, the screaming is where things started to go awry. Suddenly there was a mass exodus of minnows and mommies rushing past you to scramble up the pool steps, leaving you face to face with the monster that inspired such panic: a skunk, swimming slowly toward you from the deep end.

Clubhouse
 (in 
the 
pool
)


The main feature of this large, high-ceilinged room is the pool, of course. Some chairs are arranged around its perimiter; the back wall is covered with items both decorative and functional.




There are two exits, one that opens east to the locker rooms and one to the west that heads directly outside. It is through this door that all the moms have fled -- you can see them now through the floor-to-ceiling windows on the south side of the building, clutching their minnows tightly and waiting to see what will happen next.

Clubhouse
 (in 
the 
pool
)


The main feature of this large, high-ceilinged room is the pool, of course. Some chairs are arranged around its perimiter; the back wall is covered with items both decorative and functional.




There are two exits, one that opens east to the locker rooms and one to the west that heads directly outside. It is through this door that all the moms have fled -- you can see them now through the floor-to-ceiling windows on the south side of the building, clutching their minnows tightly and waiting to see what will happen next.




The skunk raises his tail threateningly and points it in your general direction before doing a quick somersault in the water
.

=== stonecage.z5 (v5) ===






You and Nok have been chasing the deer since before sunrise. Your legs are scratched and tired. As you approach the woods, you see smoke above the trees, and Nok stops.

Hillside


It is early, and the grass is wet. The woods are thin enough that you can see the low, yellow sun through the trees.
 Thin trails of smoke curl up into the sky above.




Nok stares at the smoke. He steps slowly back, and gestures for you to enter the forest alone.

When the world faces an insurmountable problem, Strike Force is the solution!

While the world is held at ransom, Strike Force learns of a secret HAVOC research laboratory deep in the Arctic Ocean. Major Vanguard sends Raven and Snowdrift on a midnight mission to infiltrate the station and obtain evidence of HAVOC's plans. 

And now, part 3 of "The Hydrogen Annihilator!"

The ocean at the Arctic Circle is black and still, an alien world on earth daring humanity to explore its depths. Sitting defiantly on the seabed one kilometer down lies a HAVOC research station, its evil presence a blight in the pristine waters.

Two dim, violet spotlights emerge from the inky darkness.


"Gotta hand it to HAVOC, they're nothing if not adaptable," Raven says as she survey's the station on approach.

"Yeah, vermin typically are," quips Snowdrift. "Commander, look there at the fore dome. That's a WVCA generator for temperature regulation."

"Something to keep the fascists warm?"

Snowdrift clucks his tongue, "That would be overkill, even in these waters. More likely they're experimenting with near-zero materials."

"Then you were definitely the right choice for the mission," she affirms. Arriving at the aft airlock they dismount their propulsion units, tether them to the facility, and get to work.

[You now control Raven, field commander and security expert.]

You turn to Snowdrift, "OK, remember our mission: get in, get evidence, get out. Leave no trace we were here."

Snowdrift asks, "What kind of evidence, commander?"

"Remains to be seen. HAVOC has a penchant for the dramatic, so I suspect you'll know it when you see it. First thing's first: I need to get that airlock door open for you."



Ocean, Outside the Airlock


You're outside HAVOC's secret research base in the Arctic Ocean, some 500 fathoms below. Navigation lights decorate the facility, dimly illuminating the surrounding darkness. 
The airlock door to fore is closed.



You can

Snowdrift

Something at the research facility is causing your multitool compass to behave erratically. You'll need to use nautical terms on this mission: fore (f), aft (a), port (p), and starboard (sb).

=== submarine-sabotage.z3 (v3) ===
You are currently serving aboard the USS Ibis, the first of the US Navy's top-secret Puny class submarines. The Puny class is an attack submarine that packs maximum firepower into a minimum-sized hull. It relies on speed and stealth to surprise the enemy.

The USS Ibis is currently on a training exercise in the North Atlantic, just off the coast of Newfoundland. You were doing some routine maintenance at the aft end of the submarine when the sirens sounded. You thought this might have been a training exercise until you noticed a whitish-coloured gas approaching you from the aft bulkhead. Training and instinct took over. You couldn't get to a gas mask in time, so you dived into the nearby airlock and closed the air-tight hatch behind you.

You are now alone and have no idea what is happening throughout the rest of the sub. You can't leave the airlock through the inner hatch (the one you entered by), or you'll get gassed, and you can't leave through the outer hatch, or you'll drown. What can you do?

Airlock


You're in the submarine's airlock. It's a small chamber that separates the interior of the submarine from the surrounding ocean. The inner hatch allows you to go up to the main deck of the submarine. The outer hatch allows you to go down to the ocean. The safety system is fully automated with interlocks to ensure that the two hatches can't be open simultaneously.

inner hatch
 and

Tell me what to do using simple commands starting with a verb.

Use LOOK (or L) to refresh the location description. Identify all the objects in the description and EXAMINE (or X) each one. Read responses carefully for hints.

Use nautical directions FORE, AFT, PORT and STARBOARD (or F, A, P, S) to move around. You can also use UP and DOWN (U and D). Draw a map as you go.

Use GET or TAKE to take objects and DROP to drop them again. Use INVENTORY (or I) to see what you're carrying.

Use AGAIN (or G) to repeat the last command.

Use WAIT (or Z) to pass time without doing anything in particular.


Use SAVE to save the game and RESTORE to restore it again. Use QUIT (or Q) to end the game or RESTART to restart from the beginning.

There are over 100 verbs that you can use, so if something doesn't work, try a different verb or a different way of doing things. Use HINT if you get stuck.

The Space Under the Window

=== suvehnux.z5 (v5) ===


"Yes, master?"

You rush to your master's side and await his instructions. He is studying a fragile looking scroll and muttering to himself.

He looks up and says, "Ah, there you are. This ..." -- he hands you the scroll -- " ... goes back in the vault. I believe it is still open. And this little beastie ..." -- he hands you a small, empty brass cage -- "... goes back to my private quarters. Thank you, that will be all."

You bow, and head downstairs to the vault. The heavy stone door is wide open, and a golden key juts out of the lock.

Without warning, someone shoves you roughly from behind. The scroll and the brass cage fly out of your hands as you fall to the ground. There is a loud "click", and everything turns black.

Darkness

It is pitch dark, and you can't see a thing.

Which is not good.

(It is not quite as dark as you thought. A sliver of light under the door provides a tiny amount of light, and your eyes begin to adjust to the near darkness ...)


You seem to be intact after your rough handling.



It is dark, but you are aware that you
 are dressed in a tunic, some loose trousers and a pair of black shoes, and 
are currently empty handed.

You noticed that the vial had a stopper, so nothing was spilled. (Fortunately for you; your master may have been upset if it had).

Lost Deep in the Forest


Thick, wooded forest all around reminds you of Sven. Oh, Sven! At a time like this he would be here for you, knowing the way to go. Here to massage your aching feet when you become weary. Here to tousle your blond locks when the fear overtakes you. Sven, oh Sven, where are you now?

The King and the Crown
, the first ever completed interactive fiction by 
Wes Lesley
. This work of fiction was created to be submitted to IF comp 2015, and was written in one afternoon on Sunday July fifth, 2015. I hope you have as much fun playing it as I had dreaming it up. Also, I have tried my best to make sure there are no annoyances when using text-to-speech while playing this game, however, I cannot be certain that everything will be translated smoothly into audio.

DENDERO - PALACE OF THE GOOD KING




 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
It will be a big day for you today. No, wait. It will be a 
long
 day for you today. Starting with getting your Crown out of the cabinet behind the throne and your Scepter from ... wherever it is you left it last night. You really should keep a better eye on it.




The commonfolk are already piling up to meet their beloved King. Well, I say 
'
beloved
'
 - I should say 
'
at least less despised than the ones across the border
'
. All in all you're doing an okay job. Too bad that your father just had to outdo his own father - who killed one dragon - by killing the rest of them. Now instead of questing for glory you're stuck arbitrating disputes about the truest plagues and scourges to haunt a nation as mighty as the Denderoan Empire - such as turnips.




With the Royal Coffee in one hand and the Royal Bunny Slippers on your feet, you arrive in your office. Well, 
'
office
'
. Just a fancy name for the room where you keep your chair. And 
'
chair
'
 is just a fancy name fancy people use to say 
'
throne
'
. Honestly. You'd almost think a throne was something special.




... Wait a minute.




Oh, nevermind. It's too early for this - besides! The peasants will be here soon. They're already flooding the gates of the courtyard. By Vacxll, there's got to be at least five hundred commoners outside! They'll be yapping your ear off all day... Some of them brought their dogs. Why did they bring their dogs?




Good luck, my King. I fear you may need it.






Throne Room


A big throne room north of the main hall, both right out of medieval fantasy, adorned by big red banners with the family crest on them and stained glass windows to the east, north and west. And a throne, of course. That's where you sit
 and it also blocks the view of the intricately detailed but slightly unsightly Royal Cabinet which stores the Royal Crown for Royal Safekeeping
.

Throne Room


A big throne room north of the main hall, both right out of medieval fantasy, adorned by big red banners with the family crest on them and stained glass windows to the east, north and west. And a throne, of course. That's where you sit

PROLOGUE: BREAKTHROUGH


"Due to the circumstances and lack of developments in your project so far, your contract will be terminated, effective immediately."

That's what he said. Some stupid corporate moron sitting in his office, wearing a daft suit and DigiCorp Technologies tie. Years of work, dozens of failed experiments, all the effort, simply to be phased out by a bunch of stupid company directors. As you stand alone in your laboratory, thinking about what might have been, you feel desolate. If only the blasted machinery would work!

Laboratory


The lab is a complete shambles. Hurriedly stacked pieces of paper make your workbench in the centre of the room totally unrecognisable. Steps lead up to the rooftop, the lab storeroom is to the north, and the exit from the laboratory is to the south. In one corner of the lab is the result of what is in effect your entire life's work, the translocation machine.

=== teacher.z5 (v5) ===




Welcome to the world of St Borogrund's School - a world of intrigue, mystery, deceit, and excruciatingly bad dinners. Above a scattering of ugly grey outbuildings, Borogrund's four-storey tower block rises to assault the eye in a bitter and largely futile attempt to get a second glance. 

The end of term looms, and with it the prospect of your school report. Your parents have made it very clear that the report must praise you as a talented and conscientious individual. Being none of the above - but ever loyal to your parents - you make it your quest to seek out the offending report and... amend it. 

Borogrund's isn't just a strange name. It's a strange place. Expect the unexpected. Predict the unpredictable. And for pity's sake, don't go into the staff room unprepared...

Form room


Sunlight filters into your form room, where you are obliged to register each morning and afternoon, and falls across the tables as though reluctant to get itself dusty on the linoleum floor. The school's budgetary concerns are manifested in the hard wooden chairs and scratched, worn desks which surround you. A doorway leads east.

Spend some time in every location, and examine anything that might be of interest. Talk to people: some of them will help you, but they might want something first. Collect items and use them creatively to advance in your quest.

You can always 'save' your game progress and 'restore' it later.

=== tell.z5 (v5) ===

Hello!!!! You are William Tell in this: a game about William Tell. In this game you live in Swisserland, which is where the Switzes live. The Switzes love to ski and make cheese and clocks and bank accounts. You, William Tell, are a Swiss in my game about Swisserland. You live in Swisserland City, Swisserland, which is the capital of Swisserland. The year is 1307 AD and a really bad man is PRESIDENT of Swisserland. The PRESIDENT lives in a box on top of a flagpole in the center of Swisserland City which is the capital of Swisserland and everybody who sees the box has to salute the box and say, "HELLO! BOX!!!" and act very reverential because that is where the PRESIDENT lives. This is important because you, William Tell, do not like the PRESIDENT at all and you are going to refuse to salute the box because if you don't you won't get the OPTIMAL ENDING and you won't collect all 10,000 POINTS.

You, William Tell, live in the mountains of Swisserland in a BLUE hut. Today you come down from the mountains with WILLIAM TELL JUNIOR, your SON, who eats paint chips. 

It is a regular day in Swisserland City and you are with your SON. Little do the both of you know what fate has in store for you...!



WILLIAM TELL: THE GAME!!!!!!!!!!!

Street St. in Swisserland City


This is Street St. which is the main and only street in Swisserland City. They only have one street so things don't get confusing. To the north is the center of Swisserland City, which is in the middle of the city. To the south are the north gates. There are merchants here selling lots of things and shouting a lot and waving their arms and jumping up and down, and a lot of people, and a jeep. Life in the big city sure is confusing!!!!!!


You say to your SON, "Hello, SON, stay close to me so you do not die." He stares at you blankly in response.

Further down the street


The street is packed with people here, as well, and the people come in a variety of wild shapes and colors. Right here is a man flying around with a jet pack. Over in this end is a curious fellow with a baseball for a head. Just to your right you recognize the familiar face of Vermont the grape vendor, standing in front of her box upon which a myriad of grapes of many different sizes and colors is laid.

The street goes north, towards the town square, and south. To the east is the alley of instant death.




Vermont the grape merchant is here, trying to sell her quota of five grapes before she leaves.


Vermont hands you a plump purple grape and says "Please take this plump purple grape!"

=== temple.z5 (v5) ===


Familiar as your dream may be, the shapes and the colours that surround you feel as scary as ever. For more than two months the beginning of your nightly nightmares have stayed the same. The old woman drags you up from your bed. Your struggles are in vain against the iron-hard grip of the bony hands as she pushes you out of the window. But instead of falling headlong towards the backyard below you find yourself in an alien world, trying desperately to wake up.

You plunge through limitless abysses of inexplicably coloured twilight and distorted sound, whose material and gravitational properties are beyond reason and understanding. The abysses are by no means vacant, being crowded with hazy objects, much like shadows, that are moving around in a haphazard manner.

You try to feel your body, but get only the strangest feeling. Something is there, but no reaction, no nerve pulse, feels normal. As you look down on your body you see only a haze, like those of the shadows around you.




Two of the shadows suddenly disappear.

You plunge through limitless abysses of inexplicably coloured twilight and distorted sound, whose material and gravitational properties are beyond reason and understanding. The abysses are by no means vacant, being crowded with hazy objects, much like shadows, that are moving around in a haphazard manner.

=== terror_tabby.z5 (v5) ===







You come to your senses slowly and stagger to your feet, still only half-awake, aware of something...unusual...different... 




A scabby old striped cat with a malignant gaze glares at you from beside the bed. Nothing unusual about that. You've grown accustomed to its face. It kind of makes your day begin. Sad to say.




No, it isn't the cat. It's the ticking. The sound of something ticking... 




Oh no! The cat's ticking.




It must have swallowed a bomb!

Almost Bare Bedroom


This is your almost bare bedroom. There's room for a bed - barely - but you've settled for a lumpy mattress. 
There isn't even a dresser with drawers to go through. Actually the only drawers are on the floor and they're dirty.
The living room is to the south. To the east is the bathroom.




What really gets your attention is that explosive cat leering up at you. You'd better get that cat and dispose of it before the bomb goes off!




You
 can 
see 
your scabby old tabby
 
cat
 here.

As good-looking as ever. And a lot better than whatever remains of you will look like after that cat goes off!




The malicious moggy rubs against your leg.

=== tfmdemo.z8 (v8) ===


Bored with the small selection of CDs you took with you for the long drive to your new life in Las Vegas, you incessantly flip through the five least-staticy stations in search of decent music.  On perhaps your hundredth pass through the static, the evangelists and the country music, a bright red light on the dashboard catches your attention. Your annoyance at this leg of the trip goes up a couple of notches as you identify the little red light as the low fuel indicator.  On a brighter note, you wonder at the good timing since you were getting hungry anyway.

Your anxiety increases a bit as you recall how few and far between the exits along this stretch of Interstate 40 have been. As you begin to wonder if you'll have enough gas to make it to the next exit, relief greets you after a bend in the road; an exit sign! Better still it's an exit sign of green with a smaller blue sign below it indicating fuel and food.  Things are looking up! According to those beautiful signs, you'll be filling the tank and your stomach in the "charming" little town of Dead Rock, Arkansas. You flippantly wonder where some of these town names come from...

Less than a minute later you take your exit and immediately slow down as you leave the highway and come across a "T" intersection. Welcoming some fresh country air, the electric purr of the power windows fills the car as sweet-smelling, slightly humid air fills the car. Your mood lifts immediately.  Now.  Which way to go? With no more signs to offer guidance, you shrug your shoulders and turn left.  A minute or so later of nothing but trees and bushes along the narrow, cracked road forces you to wonder if you made the right choice. Another minute of driving dispels all doubts; you pass a little green sign on the right of the road proclaiming the border into Dead Rock and its 1,247 inhabitants within. Luckily, the service station is one of the first things you see in town making it easy for you to navigate your car towards the gas pumps.

As you approach the station you notice two men in a heated argument. You can't make out what they're saying but the man holding the shotgun seems a lot angrier than the man in the gray jumpsuit who is waving his arms wildly. The perturbed man seems finished with the dialog as he aims the shotgun point-blank at the other man's chest and promptly blasts the defenseless man.  With both barrels. Thrown back several feet, the loser of the argument is dead on the ground in a quickly-expanding pool of his own blood.

The shooter seems to notice your fast-approaching car only now and aims his shotgun at the windshield! Luckily, your reflexes are faster than your brains and you duck as an explosion fills the air followed by the sound of smashing glass.  You feel small prickles of pain at a dozen points on your face but seem to be otherwise alive. Poking your head up to see where you're going, the shooter seems to be concluding his business as he points his shotgun for another chance at you. A look of disappointment tells you he's out of ammo and you're in luck.  The wild look on the greasy man's bearded face contains a shocking mix of anger, frustration and even fear all at once.  He runs off down the street westward as your car comes to a halt in front of the gas pumps. Your fight-or-flight mechanism kicks in and you decide to go after the man that tried to kill you. Without a working shotgun, a fair fight is entirely possible. You jump out of your car and start picking up speed.  Then you stop.  You slowly, painfully turn around and face the car just as you remember leaving the keys in the ignition. As if to accentuate the point that you are deeply in trouble, your car engine chooses that precise moment to sputter out from a lack of fuel.

"Good God," you think to yourself, "what kind of hell hole is this place?"


This is a test drive of The First Mile. As you explore the environs of Dead Rock, you may discover somee areas of the game are inaccessible. The full version of this title gives you unrestricted access to the entire game.

Mike's Gas & Garage


Seemingly dropped out of the sky as if from a time warp, Mike's Gas & Garage conjures up images of American life in the 1970s and 1980s. From the architecture of the building itself to the old gas pumps, you can't shake the impression that the grimy, run down conditions of Mike's business began the first day he served customers.


Grimy, weather-worn gas pumps stand as silent sentinels against the backdrop of Mike's Gas and Garage. Three car bays all have their glass doors shut with cars occupying each bay. The door to Mike's "office" is open. The road runs east and west.




A dead body lies sprawled on the ground.

~ For Jacob, Oliver, and Martha with love from Dad ~

What a happy day!  You've just finished an exciting visit with your cousins, and now it's time to head home.  It's too far to walk, so you have set out in the world to find a way home.  And, you hope, have some fun along the way.

You can type HELP to get some generic ideas, or HINT to get some ideas at any time.




Pleasant Hill


It's beautiful, sunny, and warm today.  But where you are standing, it's pleasantly cool and shady; enormous green stalks, gently waving in the wind, provide plenty of shade.  Your legs feel warm from the breeze blowing past them, but your bare feet feel pleasantly cool from the soft earth beneath you on a little hill.

It all combines to make you feel quite pleasant.  So pleasant, in fact, that you could just lay down and take a nice nap.  
Or, rather, you would, if it weren't for that huge, and rather grumpy, cricket.


The green stalks are so thick that you can't see far enough to make your way down here.  Good thing you're a fantastic climber; you'll probably have more to see up high.

There is a small path to the north
, but the cricket is standing in the middle of it.

You are in charge!  Tell me what to do.  Give me simple commands that start with verbs.  For instance, LOOK tells me to look around.  HINT has me give you a hint.

Most commands will also act in a direction or on something.  For instance, GO NORTH to go, well, north.  Or GO UP and so forth.  Some things you can pick up; for instance, TAKE SHOVEL has me pick up... yes, a shovel.

A very useful command is EXAMINE.  It means take a closer look at something.  You can EXAMINE the stalks, signs, and so forth.

SAVE your progress periodically.

You take a step or three in that direction, telling yourself you are not scared of the cricket.  The cricket watches you and seems to be.. growling?  Can crickets growl?  You're not sure, but you are pretty sure this one isn't happy to have you come closer.

You're definitely not scared of the cricket.  You simply decide it wouldn't be polite to go near, so you stay where you are.

=== the_job.z5 (v5) ===




Sure, your job has taken you on all sorts of trips and you've done some weird stuff, I mean you've got to pay the bills right? But tonight's assignment is one you didn't ask for.

Business has been slow lately, and if it hadn't been for Ricky lending you some money a few months ago, you would've had to close the firm. When Ricky showed up at your house the other day, he wasn't exactly asking if you wanted the job - it was more of an order.

And now you're here. You were busy searching in the broom closet, thinking you were alone, when you got a push from behind and fell over. Whoever pushed you also left a message...

Broom Closet


You're in the rather dirty broom closet of The Red Anchor. Various cleaning appliances line the walls. There's a pile of fabric in a corner.




A note has been fixed to the wall with a knife.




The pub lies beyond the closed door to the east.

Another day, another dollar! Life is good at the moment, the property market is booming. Still, it does have its down side; when showing those Mulluer Corporation executives around that old theatre dump, err, opportunity you must have left your pager down in the basement. Better hurry, you have to meet the others at the opera in an hour, and be careful. It wouldn't do to show up with your clothes all dirty.


Theatre Lobby


This room is a tribute to the now-faded glory of the theatre. The still-smiling faces of forgotten productions stare out from faded posters at you. An old grand staircase leads up, while the exit lies to the south. Small private doors lead northeast and northwest.

You there, you look depressed. How about I try to cheer you up, eh? Would you like to hear a story?

Well, I admit it isn't the cheeriest story, but it's an interesting one. As far as I can tell, it first appeared on an Internet imageboard years ago, but I guarantee you it's a true story. Some of the details are a bit sketchy, though, seeing as how it's been around for so long.

You'd like to hear it? Alright then. Here goes.

If you go into this one tiny, dingy one-story bar in Paris, and the right bartender is behind the counter that night, you might be able to see a very exclusive gallery show of the lost works of one Henri Beauchamp. But, to get in, you have to prove you're a devotee of the artist.

You sit down directly in front of the bartender. He asks you, in clear and perfect English, "What would you like to partake of this glorious night?"

Dingy bar


A dark, dank, dirty bar somewhere in Paris. To the south is the exit.


Behind the bartender, sitting on the shelf, are various drinks. You see bottles of absinthe, whiskey, and beer.




The bartender sits behind the counter, eying you suspiciously.




Off to the northeast you see what appears to be an old door, painted the same color as the wall. It is partially hidden in darkness.

Dingy bar


A dark, dank, dirty bar somewhere in Paris. To the south is the exit.


Behind the bartender, sitting on the shelf, are various drinks. You see bottles of absinthe, whiskey, and beer.




The bartender sits behind the counter, eying you suspiciously.




Off to the northeast you see what appears to be an old door, painted the same color as the wall. It is partially hidden in darkness.

You really expected more.

You expected to crawl through tunnels, to climb down pits, to barely escape with life. Instead you were met with a humdrum walk through a well-illuminated walkway and a canned speech on a half dozen types of stalactites. Next time you'll read the brochure with more attention... You didn't even have a chance to use your new flashlight and compass.

But wait... what's that opening by the exit?




Cave Exit


The excursion has ended, and you are standing by the end of a cave. The path back has been closed for security, and the only way to go is east and out... unless you count a narrow passage to the north.

Some suggestions for your adventure in The Great:

* Pay attention to all markings, symbols, lines and angles. If you look around, the answer will soon be obvious.
* Your other senses aside from sight are very important when cave adventuring. Even an empty room may hold the greatest secrets.
* Remember the items in your inventory. Some may be used in the most unlikely of ways!

Cave Exit
Moves:

You squeeze through the crack. The guide looks back and shouts at you to stop, but a second too late... as you fall down the pit behind the crack.




You slide down the muddy pit past several rooms. It turns into a ramp, and finally a slide through the floor, which slows down as the mud goes thin. You stand up and try to clean some of the mud as you inspect your surroundings...

[Press any key.] 


Darkness


It is pitch dark, and you can't see a thing.

=== thorn.z5 (v5) ===




"You've heard of the Holy Thorn of  Glastonbury?" Professor Wilkens takes another sip of scotch and leans forward in his wing chair. He looks at you expectantly, as if waiting for a show of hands. You know from experience he will expect you to ask him about this proposed topic, this strange thorn.

Professor Wilkens' Study


A crackling fire fills Professor Wilkens' panelled study with shadows which leap and shift, giving you the unpleasant, but absurd, sensation of furtive things moving just beyond the edges of your vision.
A closed desk sits against one wall. A single window looks out onto the night. The study door is to the east.

You
 can 
see 
Professor Wilkens
 here.

The scotch, the flickering dimness, the snow outside the window, combine to put you in a reflective mood. You and Wilkens went to school together. Perhaps you should have followed his course, moved into the cloistered halls rather than Fleet Street. Would you be more suited to a reflective life, rather than rushing about on story assignments, deadlines forever looming?



Wilkens stares down into his tumbler.

=== thornfell_manor_1984.z5 (v5) ===


The call came in just after midnight. Local officers had found one of the missing kids at Thornfell Manor. "Shred to pieces," is what they told you, and nobody dared enter the place. Except for you. As the town's sole paranatural detective, it's your job to investigate the things that leave others trembling. You quickly grab your coat, and head into the night...

A shiver runs down your spine as you make your way towards the house. There's something about this place that makes even you uneasy...




Driveway


You are standing on the driveway leading to Thornfell Manor. North continues to the house, and south takes you back to the entrance gates.

Are you sure you want to quit? 

=== threemore.z5 (v5) ===

Christmas Eve! You tell Bob to go home early; tidy up a little, and lock up the office shortly after four. You look on the old brass plate, which still reads "Scrooge & Marley", probably for the last time.

After visiting the engravers to pick up your package, you spend a few hours simply walking the busy streets, soaking in the happy anticipation all around. Then a simple, but magnificent, dinner at Kettners and a gentle stroll home. Time for bed.

Courtyard


Not everyone is complimentary about this courtyard, or the house whose front door you now face. "A gloomy set of rooms" it has been called. But it has been your home these many years; it was the site, a decade past to this very day, of the great visions that changed your life forever. And so here you stay, and here you expect to end your days. The door is north.

Others might call you elderly -- though you feel, especially at this time of year, sprightly and young. A respectable, respected, much-loved pillar of this great city. "Good old Ebenezer", they say. "There is a man who knows how to celebrate Christmas".

You shouldn't get stuck for long, and the game should never be put in an unwinnable state (though it may close off some options).Things only get importantly irrevocable in the final scene (you might like to save at this point).

If you do get stuck, it's probably my fault, not yours. But before blaming me, try the usual things: examine likely looking objects, look in and under things, talk to people. It might be worth examining yourself from time to time, too. If you want to save, a good time to do so could be at the end of each chapter. You'll know when.

This game does not use "ask" or "tell". To speak to someone type TALK TO [PERSON].

(
opening
 
the 
door
)

(unlocking the door)

As you push the door open and enter, you stop for a moment to look at the knocker. Who knows why, for you see it every day -- morning and evening, and it is unremarkable enough. But you can't forget how, on this very evening a decade ago, you saw it transformed into the very image of your late partner Jacob Marley: the first of the very strange and disconcerting events of that wonderfully disconcerting night.

So you glance at the knocker now, and you are shocked to see it, again, assume a once-familiar appearance. But this time the face is not Marley's, but almost your own, though one you have not seen for twenty, even thirty, years. It is the face of your brother, Mordecai.


Shivering slightly (whether from the cold, or the disconcerting behaviour of your door knocker, you could not say) you go through the door, light the candle that stands ready on the hall table, lock the door carefully behind you and climb the wide staircase to your chamber.



Bedroom


A leopard never quite changes its spots, and your bedroom is still plain by most standards, but that is how you like it. Nevertheless, you allow yourself a few hints of comfort if not luxury. 
The heavy green brocade curtains are 
closed
. Your table has a few papers on it
. Your bed is ready for you.
 The door, leading east, is closed.

You were just walking down the street, minding your own business, when a man in a cape passed by you.  He turned to face you, your heart skipping a beat as the sound of his feet turning on the street echoed in your ears.  Then there was a sharp pain in the back of your head, and everything went black...

Round Room


You're in a circular room, with old, worn stones set into the wall.  Torches rest in brackets on the wall, lighting the area well enough for you to see.  A narrow corridor heads north, and that seems to be the only exit from here.



There's some sort of panel on the wall nearby.

Corridor


This is a north-south corridor.  Unfortunately, you're not safe here from the descending ceiling.  The corridor is actually a dead end, so you can only go back to the round room.



There's a hole in the floor here
.



You
 can 
also 
see 
a
 
glass tube
 (which is closed)
 (in 
which 
is 
a
 
piece of paper
)
 here.



It begins to occur to you that the ceiling is moving... DOWNWARD!  You'd better find a way out pretty soon.

=== traffic.z5 (v5) ===







Let's be honest. When you took the position as Junior Research Lab Assistant at the Orzel Particle Physics Institute, you weren't expecting anything glamorous. 'A post-doc has to start somewhere,' you told yourself. 'I don't want to teach a bunch of over-privileged undergrads,' you convinced yourself. 'I'd be working for Dr. Roth, who has a pretty good reputation,' you pondered. And finally 'It pays enough to move out of my parent's house,' you realized, with just a tiny amount of glee.

But here you are, seven months later, wondering if you made the right choice. Working for Dr. Roth at the Institute has been some of the most uninspiring work you've ever done. It doesn't help that most of the time, the 'research' tasks he gives you are mostly manual labor. How many times does a person really need to clean the plates for the proportional drift chamber?  And moving heavy spectrometers from lab room to lab room isn't what you had in mind when you were told the Institute was working on problems that required 'heavy lifting'.

So this morning, when you were interrupted and told to pick up the shipment of unstable Cesium-7 isotopes that had erroneously been dropped off by the post office to an address three blocks away, you were disappointed, but not surprised. 'At least you'll get some fresh air,' Dr. Roth told you with a thin veneer of disdain.

After obtaining the package, you're finally on your way back to the lab.

The corner of Jones and Elm


It's mid-morning
, and you are waiting at the intersection of Jones street and Elm street. Traffic is moving 
slowly 
along Jones headed east, and along Elm headed north. The traffic lights are working, and if the pedestrian walk light would ever change, you could walk across Jones and head north back to the lab.


A 5-foot tall metal box sits bolted to the sidewalk nearby, under one of the traffic light posts.

The sidewalks are mostly devoid of pedestrians, although you do notice a woman slowly walking towards Elm street pushing a baby stroller.

You notice a bus slowly trying to get through the intersection.

It's not much of a job, but the Dungeon Master was looking for a guard troll, so you volunteered. You were given the standard-issue axe, and told to... well, guard.

The Troll Room


This is a small room with passages to the east and south and a forbidding hole leading west. Bloodstains and deep scratches (perhaps made by an axe) mar the walls.

The Troll Room


This is a small room with passages to the east and south and a forbidding hole leading west. Bloodstains and deep scratches (perhaps made by an axe) mar the walls.

This must be your 30th time up the stairs today, but fortunately, this is your final trip. All the laundry and cleaning are done, the carpets shampooed and the beds made. All that's left to do is to put away the last load of laundry, make a cocktail, and unwind in a hot bath while the carpets dry. 

However, as you attempt the last of fourteen steps, your foot finds a small toy car inconveniently located as to cause your feet to go west while your head goes east. East, a direction typically no worse than any other direction, unfortunately at this time offers the corner of a banister. Your head's progression is significantly hampered by this obstruction, and as the resulting 'THUMP' resonates throughout the house, your head decides it isn't worth staying awake to investigate further.

You awake somewhat later to find your head no worse for wear but a little foggy, a little confused, and more than a little out of touch....

On the Floor



You are lying on the floor staring at the ceiling. Your head feels surprisingly good considering your previous antics. In fact, you feel quite refreshed from your hiatus from consciousness.

Just as you start to move, a grizzly little man about four feet tall wearing a red scarf and a black cowboy hat comes in from the bedroom to the north. After a quick glance, the little man bends over and extracts your gold watch from your wrist in one swift movement. As the man examines the watch, a raspy voice yells out, "Frank, get yer carcass outta here and down below where ya belong. Dadgummit anyhow!" The startled little man looks around and runs to the north with spurs clattering. Something drops from his pocket during his hasty exit.

Since losing your ticket you've been unable to get out of the underground system; heaven knows how long you've spent wandering around. Anyway, whether it's days or weeks, you're absolutely famished -- you simply must find something to eat.

TUBE TROUBLE is a mini-adventure by Richard Tucker, based on a 1988 BBC Micro game by Richard Tucker and Damian Gamble. Gareth Rees made many helpful suggestions. It was created with Inform, Graham Nelson's infocom-format adventure game compiler, and may be copied freely.

As this is a short, silly, unreasonable game, you may be killed without warning.

Please email bugs and comments to Richard.Tucker@cl.cam.ac.uk.

                              ******************** 

It is a very strange time and place you find yourself in.

Earth. North America. Early 1998.


From readily available information, and the pronounced fears of a few politicians and information technology leaders, it is obvious to you that things are about to fall apart. Yet the world at large seems blissfully ignorant. Most citizens pay little attention to history and are unfamiliar with how unusually blessed latter-20th-century North Americans have been. 

Peace. Prosperity. We live for entertainment, money, and immediate gratification. 

Most people seem unwilling to believe that the geniuses who've given us all the technology we take for granted could possibly have painted us all into a corner with the Year 2000 century change problem, also known as the "Millennium Bomb" or "Y2K". 

On the other hand, a small but rapidly growing percentage of people - mostly information workers with above-average intelligence - are already predicting the breakdown of banks, stock markets, aviation, public utilities, ... maybe even society itself. 

You are an employee of Biritzcom. It is early 1998. Since this is the demo version, there is a demo fairy flitting about your head, limiting your experimentation to 20 moves for each of Uh-Oh!'s 5 phases. 

(To order the full version, use the ORDERING command.) 

I suggest you examine your computer ...

Yesterday, as you were walking through Central Park, a meteorite crashed nearby, bathing you in cosmic radiation.  It only made the twelth page of the paper, under Dear Abby.  Of course, if anyone could have foreseen the awful effects of that accident, it surely would have been a front page story.  But there was no way for you, or anyone else, to predict that the result of that accident would be....

Your Bedroom
 (

)


Home sweet home for a '60s throwback bachelor like yourself.  Assorted, but unimportant decorations litter the walls and ceiling.  To the west is a door that, as you fuzzily recall, leads into your walk-in closet.  To the east is a hallway, that, as you even more fuzzily recall, leads to the kitchen.

=== uninvited.z5 (v5) ===


Look out!!! The last thing you remember before the darkness rushed up to claim you is your brother's startled cry. You managed to swerve around the shadowy figure that appeared in the roadway, but lost control as the car jumped the shoulder and plunged headlong into this tree.

Swiveling your battered head you survey the wreckage. You realize that you are alone: your kid brother must have gone off to get some help. As you pry yourself free of the steering wheel's embrace, you can't help but notice the pungent odor of gasoline as it leaks from the ruptured gas tank.

Your Car


You sit at the wheel of your car, the front of which is now wrapped around a large tree. You can hear the dripping of fluids as they escape beneath your vehicle. This auto is not going anywhere without a tow truck. Through the windshield you see the exterior of a mansion.



The driver's side door
 looks bashed in.




You 
can
 also
 see 
a 
glovebox
 (which 
is
 closed)
 here.

You have travelled through a long-forgotten valley, cut deep into the Carpathian mountains. This is Transylvania, an ancient land of mystery and superstition. A freezing cold mist fills this bleak landscape. Swollen, wrath-filled clouds rumble ominously above hag-ridden magic and enchanted woods. The melancholy days are come. The saddest of the year, of wailing winds and naked woods. From somewhere deep in the forest, you hear the howling of the wolves.

The Dead Forest


You are standing in a forest. Before you is the entrance to an ancient black castle. Huge stone walls covered in moss and thick vines reach high into the late afternoon sky. 

A small forest path winds SOUTH, deep into the forest, or you can go WEST through a collapsed archway.

Not A French Balcony


You aren't in Venice. What you do isn't important at this moment, but what you don't is.

It has been five days, now. Five days since I made the choice. Five days since I closed the gate.

Really, there was no choice. Rovato was damned when the first spot appeared: when the first bloody cough ensued from the mouth of an urchin. To have allowed the sick sanctuary at Saint Cuthbert's would only have damned us as well.

But we were already damned.

The plague came. And now we suffer.

Six crisp chimes mark Vespers. Your heart flutters for a moment, and you place your head in your hands.




Your Bedroom


Your room is small; it is the same as all the others, but it seems smaller of late. With so many of your brothers gone, there has been little for you to do but wait. Wait for the spots to appear in this tiny, dark room. 

A chill breeze spins in through the window and out the door to the west.




Your old desk is pushed up against one side. It sags but holds itself up proudly.




Against the other side is your bed, the blanket wrapped up in itself from this morning.

You're not the man you were a few days ago. Your skin hangs as sallow drapes around your jaw: your hands are emaciated. Your frock billows about you; it is difficult to find any flesh within. The only solace you find in looking at yourself is that, so far, no signs of the plague are within you.

Your Office
 (on 
the 
office chair
)


Your office is a small austere room with a bare floor and a desk at the south wall, covered with piles of various work papers. 
The office lamp provides soft white light. 
At one side of the desk, your computer 
is humming softly, the familiar sound of the ventilation filling the office. 
Currently, you are sitting behind your desk, on your old office chair. 
The office door is to the east, and there is a 
closed 
window in the west wall.

[Any key]


Your mind dissolves as it touches the pillow. Today has been a busy day, and tomorrow will probably be no differant. But your not thinking about that, because your mind has already dissolved.

Like liquid, your thoughts drip together, falling from mist and mildew. Soon a dream forms. A small lizard is dancing to bad jazz. He's on his hind legs, kicking like Russians must have kicked during the Cold War. After what seems like minutes, he turns to you. His tounge flickers like a dying candle. There are no sounds, yet his tounge's writhing and curls seem to talk. "I am the Toe. Tips nil like math ah tame kill in spit."  Then the tounge stretches over to your face and pokes your eyes. Blinded, your nostrils suddenly become extrasensory as the scent of burn engine oil streams in. Then your ears go into overdrive as a manic laughter surrounds your being. The scariest part, is your not so sure that it's not you laughing. You start running. Blindly.

There is an open door to the south.


Gladys is sitting in the chair.

Uncle Seamore is a scientific wizard. Other members of your family may dispute this and warn you not to hang around "Simple Simon" for fear of some of his craziness rubbing off on you, but even as far back as your earliest memories you have always seen him for the genius he is.

True, he is a bit of a hermit and many of his experiments do run awry; but his odd ways can easily be explained by the fact that he was trapped in the basement of a closed garage for close to ten years. Now he has disappeared for a second time leaving no message of his whereabouts. The rest of the family simply laugh, joking that he is probably locked in another basement; but you know better. You are closer to Uncle Seamore than anyone else, and you know that he would tell you if he were planning on leaving. You fear the worst and decide to search his apartment for any clues that might tell you where he is...

Dining Room



This is the dining room. Your uncle never saw the need to buy furniture that he would never use so the room is pretty empty. There is, however, a yellow line stretching North and South across the floor which divides the room in half. Passages lead North, East, and West. The apartment exit lies to the South.

Laboratory



What should probably be called the living room has served as your uncle's laboratory for years. Though there has been a large assortment of equipment and tools in here in the past, it has now all been cleared away to make room for your uncle's newest project: a huge machine of some sort that takes up more than three-quarters of the room. The only exit is to the South.

=== warp.z5 (v5) ===


 
You're on a space station.  This is nothing special in itself, but for some reason, due to your body's genetics, your very presence is causing the station to become unstable.  Stay aboard, and the station will explode. 

You wake up this morning, intending to leave.  Unfortunately, the station's instability has already caused the station layout to change dramatically, and no one on the station even recognizes you...

Bedroom


This is a rather sparse bedroom.  About the only thing here is your bed
, which folds up into one of the floor tiles.
  Exits lead north, west and east.

Intersection


You are at the corner of a hallway.  Your room is to the south.  You may also exit to the north, west or east.




You can see a security guard here.  He sees that you are wearing nothing and arrests you for indecent exposure. 

Next time, show a little less vanity.

Do you want to play in Classic mode, Normal mode, Statistician mode or Cartographer mode?

Classic mode is as close as possible to the original text, including typos and miscellaneous ugliness. If you're not on a nostalgia trip, normal mode contains less typos and presents a few things (such as the final game summary) in a slightly neater way. Statistician mode is similar to normal mode but uses the status line to display your attributes and equipment instead of printing them out at the start of each turn. Cartographer mode ('m'ap mode) uses the status line to display a map of the current dungeon level.

The other notable difference is in the coordinate systems. In the original game, the 'x' axis was the vertical axis, and the 'y' axis the horizontal. All the new versions use the normally-accepted axes. This change manifests itself only in the displaying of coordinates and in teleporting, so the only thing to bear in mind is that whichever mode you are playing in, you simply need to enter the coordinates when teleporting in the same order as they are printed.

Orb of Zot
. From that time hence, many
a bold youth has ventured into the Wizard's castle. As

Waiting on the shore; sand yields beneath my feet
The water shouts and roars and rushes
And breaks on the rocks, and
Never comes near to where I wait.

The picnic is going full blast, which is exactly why you've wandered away from it. It's not that you don't like your new companions; it's just that after weeks of spending each day around them, a noisy weekend cook-out isn't the way to relax. Some exploration -- on your own -- is an appealing thought.

None of them noticed you drifting away, anyhow.

Edge Of Meadow


The grasses are fragrant under the sunshine of a late, late summer afternoon. A stream chatters by at your feet, and a weathered old wooden bridge stretches across it to the east. Beyond the stream, a scrubby hillside stretches upward.




The shouts of the volleyball players and the boom-box thump are pleasantly far off to the west.

"You are cordially invited to the wedding of Deborah and Malcolm at St Jude's Church, Westlowe at 2.30pm." And, scrawled in the corner in what looks like your ex-flatmate Malcolm's handwriting: "Don't forget the paracetamol!"

So far so bad. You're no lover of weddings with egotistical aunts and uncles and squealing, hyperactive kids, but you were prepared to put up with it to see your old college chum get hitched. Now, though, things have taken a turn for the worse with a phone call from a posh sounding woman. "I understand you're a friend of Malcolm's" stated the voice on the phone. "You 
must 
come over here at once, and try to sort out this mess...". So that's why you find yourself tearing down the motorway towards Westlowe and the mysterious D'Arcy manor...

Outside the front entrance


You stand to the south of D'Arcy manor, a building which looks like it's straight out of a low budget Bronte TV adaptation. A few modern touches help tie it to the late twentieth century, such as the burglar alarm next to the elegant stone carving of a Shakespearian-looking man above the main entrance. Immediately in front of the house is a gravel drive which acts as a car park, and a small road leads off to the south towards the main road. A slabbed path runs around both sides (east and west) of the house.

Jace's Room
 (on 
the 
bed
)


Sleek white walls surround your futuristic bedroom, which has been your abode for as long as you can remember. The room is disorganized enough that you nonetheless never know what's hiding in it. Your large bed with its rumpled sheets lies in the southwest corner, opposite a chest of drawers. A writing desk and a stool stand next to you, and a wastebasket lies nearby. A door leads north to a bathroom, and a western door leads to a hall.

Steel Cube
 (on 
the 
slab
)


Somehow, you've wound up inside an apparently seamless cube of polished steel, about 20 feet on a side
, with a stone slab near the center.




A black floor lamp stands near the slab, illuminating the whole space.




A long lever 
lies against one wall.

Winter Wonderland
Release Version 2.0


Copyright 1999 Laura A. Knauth

.:*"*:._.:*"*:._.:*"*:._.:*"*:._.:*"*:._.:*"*:._.:*"*:._.:*"*:._.:*"*:.

In a far off land, there lies a little village nestled in a snowy mountainscape. As the townsfolk joyously prepare for the coming winter solstice, a young girl living with her family in a humble hut at the outskirts of town gains no comfort in the festivities. Her closest companion, her younger brother Sander Bales, has fallen seriously ill with a fever and can barely lift his head from the bed upon which he lies. Young Gretchen could hardly have suspected that such circumstances would cause the fanciful events that were to occur upon this solstice eve.

NOTE: At any time, you may view HINTS, CREDITS, or read some words about the MAKING of Winter Wonderland by typing the all-caps word on the command line.

Small Bedroom


A small, sickly boy is lying on a bed that takes up most of the space in this room. Light filters in through drab curtains hung around the only window in this bedroom. A long dark drapery hangs down over a portion of the east wall.




Small, disheveled shoes lie at the foot of the bed.

The memo was something of a surprise. You'd featured rather heavily in the issue before, and had reasonably suspected that the editor wouldn't want to see hide nor hair of you for a while. However, summoned you have been.

The trouble with these meetings is, you'll never know where it'll lead; whether he'll ask you to write a few hundred words for a box-out, or to spend a day tramping round the London suburbs in search of the homes of C-list celebrities. Maybe it'll just be a straight commission. And if you're really blessed, he'll fall into the usual trap of rattling off so much information in the meeting that you'll only need to transcribe what you can remember. Such are the misdemeanours available to you when your boss is disturbingly well-informed and in love with the sound of his own voice.

Still, you've not much time. Best get your skates on, especially if the receptionist is in one of his difficult moods...

Much of this interactive article is conversational. You can ask people about things and tell people about things using the ask and tell commands, such as:
"ask receptionist about aspadistra" which you can shorten to:
"ask about aspadistra"; or "ask aspadistra"; or even "a aspadistra".

August 24th, 2165.

Utopia Technologies. Industrial giant, economic powerhouse, the world's greatest scientific superpower, and the organisation most responsible for eroding civil liberties and personal freedoms. They're an all-powerful capitalist megacorporation that you despise completely and utterly, yet you're perfectly willing to join their ranks.

The paperwork has been filed, and you're on the way to the California Archipelago in a transport shuttle. There's no turning back now. Tomorrow morning, you'll be a citizen of Utopia, based in the Arcology -- that overcrowded, polluting eyesore of gargantuan proportions. You'll be a mere immigrant worker at the bottom of the corporate ladder, but your stomach still churns at the thought. Your motives for going may be pure, but that doesn't make it easy.

The journey from China has been uneventful, giving you plenty of time to think of your upcoming mission, and the massive responsibility that's been placed on your slender shoulders.




Civilian Transport Shuttle


As opposed to say, a military or executive shuttle, which would have seats to make the trip comfortable and an in-flight holomovie to ease the tedium of a three hour flight from Shanghai. Instead, this is the basic civvie model -- you're densely packed in a titanium can with over fifty other Chinese immigrants. The cabin reeks of sweat but there is nowhere to go, and at this altitude, opening the viewing windows would be the queen of bad ideas.

Miss Alice Ling. Mid twenties, shoulder length black hair, brown eyes, average height and build -- by all appearances, a perfectly ordinary Chinese woman in good health. You're pretty enough to be disarming when needed, but not overly sexy as to attract unwanted attention. All in all, walking evidence that looks can be deceiving.

Civilian Transport Shuttle


As opposed to say, a military or executive shuttle, which would have seats to make the trip comfortable and an in-flight holomovie to ease the tedium of a three hour flight from Shanghai. Instead, this is the basic civvie model -- you're densely packed in a titanium can with over fifty other Chinese immigrants. The cabin reeks of sweat but there is nowhere to go, and at this altitude, opening the viewing windows would be the queen of bad ideas.

You may renew your water supply completely at an oasis. 
You get half a quart if found by help. 
If help does not find you after command six, you lose.

Useful commands:

   The 'BRIEF' command suppresses printing of long room descriptions for rooms which have been visited.  The 'SUPERBRIEF' command suppresses printing of long room descriptions for all rooms.  The 'VERBOSE' command restores long descriptions. 
   The 'INFO' command prints information which might give some idea of what the game is about. 
   The 'QUIT' command prints your score and asks whether you wish to continue playing. 
   The 'SAVE' command saves the state of the game for later continuation. 
   The 'RESTORE' command restores a saved game. 
   The 'INVENTORY' command lists the objects in your possession. 
   The 'LOOK' command prints a description of your surroundings. 
   The 'SCORE' command prints your current score and ranking. 
   The 'TIME' command tells you how long you have been playing. 
   The 'DIAGNOSE' command reports on your injuries, if any.

Command abbreviations:

   The 'INVENTORY' command may be abbreviated 'I'. 
   The 'LOOK' command may be abbreviated 'L'. 
   The 'QUIT' command may be abbreviated 'Q'.

Containment:

   Some objects can contain other objects.  Many such containers can be opened and closed.  The rest are always open.   They may or may not be transparent.  For you to access (e.g., take) an object which is in a container, the container must be open.  For you to see such an object, the container must be either open or transparent.  Containers have a capacity, and objects have sizes; the number of objects which will fit therefore depends on their sizes.  You may put any object you have access to (it need not be in your hands) into any other object.  At some point, the program will attempt to pick it up if you don't already have it, which process may fail if you're carrying too much.  Although containers can contain other containers, the program doesn't access more than one level down.


Fighting:

   Occupants of the dungeon will, as a rule, fight back when attacked.  In some cases, they may attack even if unprovoked. Useful verbs here are 'ATTACK <villain> WITH <weapon>', 'KILL', etc.  Knife-throwing may or may not be useful.  You have a fighting strength which varies with time.  Being in a fight, getting killed, and being injured all lower this strength. Strength is regained with time.  Thus, it is not a good idea to fight someone immediately after being killed.  Other details should become apparent after a few melees or deaths.

Command parser:

   A command is one line of text terminated by a carriage return. For reasons of simplicity, all words are distinguished by their first nine letters.  All others are ignored.  For example, typing 'DISASSEMBLE THE ENCYCLOPEDIA' is not only meaningless, it also creates excess effort for your fingers.  Note that this truncation may produce ambiguities in the interpretation of longer words.

   You are dealing with a fairly stupid parser, which understands the following types of things--

   Actions: 
        Among the more obvious of these, such as TAKE, PUT, DROP, etc. 
        Fairly general forms of these may be used, such as PICK UP, 
        PUT DOWN, etc.

   Directions: 
        NORTH, SOUTH, UP, DOWN, etc. and their various abbreviations. 
        Other more obscure directions (LAND, CROSS) are appropriate in 
        only certain situations.

   Objects: 
        Most objects have names and can be referenced by them.

   Adjectives: 
        Some adjectives are understood and required when there are 
        two objects which can be referenced with the same 'name' (e.g., 
        DOORs, BUTTONs).

   Prepositions: 
        It may be necessary in some cases to include prepositions, but 
        the parser attempts to handle cases which aren't ambiguous 
        without.  Thus 'GIVE CAR TO DEMON' will work, as will 'GIVE DEMON 
        CAR'.  'GIVE CAR DEMON' probably won't do anything interesting. 
        When a preposition is used, it should be appropriate;  'GIVE CAR 
        WITH DEMON' won't parse.

   Sentences: 
        The parser understands a reasonable number of syntactic construc- 
        tions.  In particular, multiple commands (separated by commas) 
        can be placed on the same line.

   Ambiguity: 
        The parser tries to be clever about what to do in the case of 
        actions which require objects that are not explicitly specified. 
        If there is only one possible object, the parser will assume 
        that it should be used.  Otherwise, the parser will ask. 
        Most questions asked by the parser can be answered.

=== zegro.z8 (v8) ===


You are Zegrothenus, a wizard of some renown, respected for many potions and infamous for a few magical items (but those were experiments in your youth!). It was a dark and stormy night when you learned that your wizard's license would not be automatically renewed this year; the new Council bylaw required all member wizards to invent one artifact every half-decade.


You demanded an explanation. They did not have you specifically in mind, the Council said -- the Council being Faluna, Galadel the Fiery, and Jokan -- but you knew better. Jokan never liked you ("Earth wizards reek," he had informed you three years ago to this day); Galadel considered potions to be strictly amateur; and Faluna, you should have known that half-elves would take break-ups hard. They sent you to your lab, and then those -- curse them! -- "wizards" magically sealed the exits! They set up a pouring potion, as if to mock you, to illustrate how much time you had left. They even said that such measures were required by your penchant for procrastination! The swine!


Moments trickled by as you considered your options. At last, you balled your hands into fists. Very well! You would escape the fastest way possible, by whipping up a potion to startle them all. THAT would show that smirking Council!


You look around your woefully understocked lab, every step reminding you of something else missing. Heaving a deep sigh, you find consolation only in your well-stocked library and extensive glassware collection. You will make a potion, but which one should you make? The question confounds you; all you can think of doing is paging through your formulary until inspiration strikes.

Laboratory (By the Table)


You are standing in the center of your laboratory, by the circular chest-level table that looks like the stump of a tree. On further inspection, however, the table reveals that it is comprised of finely-corrugated steel painted and shaped to mimic natural wood. The table sprouts upwards like a mushroom, with an oak vat crouching beneath its eaves and a ceramic black cover, that at one time slid back to allow access to the hollow core. Your glassware spans the surface, and a steel band just below the surface provides hooks for tools. Suspended from the ceiling horizontally in the center of a rusty chain, a low oil lamp provides a bright yellow-gold light.



In addition to all your glassware, the lab table holds:
 
flask one
, 
flask two
, 
flask three
, 
flask four
, 
a 
lead tray
 and 
a 
mortar
.



Eri sits on her haunches, right behind you, as if expecting something.



That accursed reddish potion floats in the air, frothy-white vapors escaping. 
Over three-fourths remains.

Your glassware spans the surface, and a steel band just below the surface provides hooks for tools. Suspended from the ceiling horizontally in the center of a rusty chain, a low oil lamp provides a bright yellow-gold light.



In addition to all your glassware, the lab table holds:
 
flask one
, 
flask two
, 
flask three
, 
flask four
, 
a 
lead tray
 and 
a 
mortar
.



That accursed reddish potion floats in the air, frothy-white vapors escaping. 
Over three-fourths remains.

                                 Escape from Starship Zenon.


                               [Press any button to continue]






















The story so far:


Accused of multi-planaterial murder and thrown in the high-security brig of a large federal starship with a life sentence. What a downer. There's probably some fiendishly tricky and elusive way to escape from here if you put your mind to it, you know.



Over to you.



Type help for help. Please read the read me.

If you ever get out of here, you really must complain to the prison's standards officers. This place is dirtier and dustier than a dirt factory. If you didn't have better things to do, you'd be in the right mind too give the place a jolly good clean just too spite it. There's a heavily built door to the south.



You
 can 
see 
a 
door
, 
a 
bed
, 
a 
pressure guage
 and 
a 
light switch
 here.

THE Z-FILES


An Interactive Guide to available Z-Code files.
Copyright (c) 1998 by Gunther Schmidl <sothoth@usa.net>.
With entries based on Inform Game List by Brendon Wyber/Neil Brown.
Latest changes under "Products in Progress."

This is a list of all English Z-code files that are legally available. Therefore, it includes mainly files compiled by Graham Nelson's Inform, but Activision has released some old Infocom games into the public.

Please understand that due to the majority of English games, "minorities" like German and Spanish games cannot be supported.

ZOMBIES
 - Yet another abuse of the 
Z-Machine

A nostalgic diversion by David Magnus Ledgard with a large portion
of the code shamelessly borrowed from Torbjörn Andersson, a
tiny tiny portion being lifted from Infocom's "The Lurking Horror".

>LOOK

Dead Storage

This is a storage room. It contains an incredible assemblage of discarded junk. Some of it is so old and mouldering that you can't be sure where one bit of junk stops and the next begins. It's piled to the ceiling on ancient, rotting pallets. A narrow path winds eastward through the junk.


>SEARCH JUNK

You find many worthless items of hardware, old discarded memos and papers, but nothing of any use or value. But wait...
What's that in the corner? A lesser adventurer may have passed this by but not you. It seems to be an old Commodore PET computer and looks like it just might work. Next to the computer are two tapes one with the word "Zombies" scrawled on it in Biro. The other one is labeled "Wrap". Behind the computer on the wall is a power outlet.


>EXAMINE COMPUTER

In computer years this computer is older than Noah's Ark, but in actual years it is a little over two decades old. It consists of a monochrome monitor, tape deck, keyboard (with lots of funny little symbols on the letter keys including hearts, diamonds, spades, clubs, and corners, sides and crosses to allow the user to draw boxes on the screen), on/off switch and power cable; all build into one convenient trapezoidal unit. Performance wise it uses an 8 Bit MOS 6502 processor, has a whopping 4K of memory and the BASIC language on a built in ROM.


>PLUG POWER CABLE INTO POWER OUTLET

Done.


>TURN COMPUTER ON

You switch the computer on.
The screen lights up and the word "Ready." appears in bright green text with a flashing green cursor beneath it.


>PUT ZOMBIES TAPE IN TAPE DECK

(Taking the Zombies Tape first)

Done.


>TYPE LOAD "ZOMBIES" AND PRESS PLAY ON TAPE DECK

Done.
Done.
The word "Loading" appears on the screen and the tape starts spinning.


>WAIT.
The tape is still spinning but not much else is happening.


>WAIT.
The tape is still spinning but not much else is happening.


>WAIT.
The tape is still spinning but not much else is happening.


>WAIT.
At last the tape stops spinning and the word "Ready." appears on the screen.


>TYPE RUN
The screen displays, "Do you want (s)hallow or (d)eep pits?"

Welcome to adventure.


You are in an open field west of a big white house, with a closed, locked
front door.

You are talking to an extremely stupid parser.  It understands sentences
of the following types:
one word:  must be a direction ("North" or "N", "Down" or "D", etc.;),
     an action which requires no object ("Light", "Enter",...) or a
     magic word, if you know one.  Some words, such as articles and
     prepositions, are ignored:  "The north" is just like "North".  In
     addition, "Inventory" lists your possessions, and "Look" gives the
     long description of the room you're currently in, with its
     contents.
two word:  "Take frobozz", "Kick chomper", and so on.
three word:  Typically a sentence which has an object and a target: 
     "Throw the spear at the snake," for example.  "Throw spear snake"
     will work, as, strangely, will "Throw snake spear."  "Throw spear"
     will work if there is something reasonable to throw it at;
     otherwise it is usually like "Drop spear."  Some objects may do
     something else when thrown.
All words are five letters long; anything extra is discarded.  Objects
frequently have several names, and there may be several ways of
performing the same action.  "Walk north" is like "North", for example. 
Some verbs are meaningful only in certain contexts:  you usually can't
"Give" something unless there is something there to take it; to "Eat"
you have to have some food.  Some verbs aren't known at all;
usually you'll find out about them the hard way.  Etc.


>
You are facing the north side of a white house.  There is no door here,
and all the windows are barred.


>
I don't know that word.


>
Were you to quit, your score would be 
0
 [total of 
285
 points], in

 moves.


This score gives you the rank of

To:      Captain, USS Enterprise, NCC-1701


From:    Starfleet Command


Subject: War Warning


1. Approximately three (3) hours ago, warships of the Imperial Klingon Empire Navy crossed the border into Federation space. These vessels have destroyed all outposts and ships in their path and have not answered any hails.


2. Therefore, effective immediately, a state of war exists between the United Federation of Planets and the Imperial Klingon Empire.


3. As the Enterprise is the only vessel available in this portion of the galaxy, your orders are as follows:


4. Engage and destroy any and all Klingon vessels you encounter within your designated patrol zone. Long range sensor scans indicate a total of 
20
 Klingon battlecruisers in your area.


5. Starfleet Operations calculates that it will take approximately 
32
 days to mobilize our forces and begin sending reinforcements to the front. We need you to hold off the invading Klingon fleet until those reinforcements arrive.


6. Good luck and good hunting.
